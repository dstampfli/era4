Overall Gross Bookings increased by $22.5 billion in 2023, up 19%, or 20% on a constant currency basis, compared to 2022. Mobility Gross Bookings grew 32% year-over-year, on a constant currency basis, primarily due to increases in Trip volumes. Delivery Gross Bookings grew 15% year-over-year, on a constant currency basis, primarily driven by an increase in delivery orders and higher basket sizes. Freight Gross Bookings declined 25% year-over-year, on a constant currency basis, primarily attributable to lower revenue per load and volume both a consequence of the challenging freight market cycle. Revenue was $37.3 billion, up 17% year-over-year. Mobility revenue increased $5.8 billion primarily attributable to an increase in Mobility Gross Bookings of 31% year-over-year. Delivery revenue increased $1.3 billion primarily attributable to an increase in Delivery Gross Bookings of 14% year-over-year. Revenue growth was partially offset by a $1.7 billion decrease in our Freight business, with Freight Gross Bookings declining 25% year-over-year. Additionally, the increase in Mobility and Delivery revenue was partially offset by business model changes in some countries that classified certain sales and marketing costs as contra revenue, which negatively impacted revenue by $368 million and $796 million across Mobility and Delivery, respectively. Net income attributable to Uber Technologies, Inc. was $1.9 billion, which includes the favorable impact of a pre-tax unrealized gain on debt and equity securities, net, of $1.6 billion primarily related to changes in the fair value of our equity securities, including: a $985 million net unrealized gain on our Aurora investment, a $443 million net unrealized gain on our Didi investment, a $84 million net unrealized gain on our Joby investment, and a $80 million net unrealized gain on our Grab investment. Adjusted EBITDA was $4.1 billion, growing $2.3 billion year-over-year. Mobility Adjusted EBITDA profit was $5.0 billion, up $1.7 billion year-over-year. Delivery Adjusted EBITDA profit was $1.5 billion, up $955 million year-over-year. These increases were partially offset by a $216 million increase in Corporate G&A and Platform R&D costs, year-over-year, as well as a $64 million decrease in Freight Adjusted EBITDA year-over-year. We ended the year with $5.4 billion in unrestricted cash, cash equivalents and short-term investments. 50\",\n",

Management applies judgment in determining whether the Company is the principal or agent in transactions with Drivers, Merchants and end-users. This determination impacts the presentation of revenue on a gross or net basis as well as the presentation of incentives provided to Drivers and Merchants and discounts and promotions offered to end-users, to the extent they are not customers. For the year ended December 31, 2023, the Company's Mobility and Delivery revenue, net of incentives, was $32.0 billion and discounts, loyalty programs, promotions, refunds, and credits provided to end-users who are not customers totaled $1.7 billion, of which a significant portion relates to discounts and promotions. The principal considerations for our determination that performing procedures relating to the presentation of Mobility and Delivery revenue agreements, including incentives, discounts and promotions to Drivers, Merchants, and end-users is a critical audit matter are the significant judgment by management in assessing the presentation of revenue on a gross or net basis, as well as the presentation of incentives, discounts and promotions offered to Drivers, Merchants, and end-users, which in turn led to a high degree of auditor judgment, subjectivity and effort in performing procedures and evaluating audit evidence relating to whether transaction attributes were appropriately analyzed and presented by management. Addressing the matter involved performing procedures and evaluating audit evidence in connection with forming our overall opinion on the consolidated financial statements. These procedures included testing the effectiveness of controls relating to the Company's revenue recognition process, including controls over the presentation of Mobility and Delivery revenue, incentives, discounts and promotions. These procedures also included, among others, testing, on a sample basis, trip transaction attributes and assessing management's classification of new or changed agreements by examining documentation related to the agreement terms, driver statements, rider receipts, and discount, promotion and incentive terms, and assessing the impact of those terms and attributes on the presentation of revenue and income statement classification.\",\n",

We develop and operate proprietary technology applications supporting a variety of offerings on our platform (\"platform(s)” or “Platform(s)\"). We connect consumers (“Rider(s)”) with independent providers of ride services (“Mobility Driver(s)\") for ridesharing services, and connect Riders and other consumers (\"Eater(s)\") with restaurants, grocers and other stores (collectively, \"Merchants\") with delivery service providers (\"Couriers\") for meal preparation, grocery and other delivery services. Riders and Eaters are collectively referred to as \"end-user(s)\" or \"consumer(s).\" Mobility Drivers and Couriers are collectively referred to as \"Driver(s).\" We also connect consumers with public transportation networks. We use this same network, technology, operational excellence and product expertise to connect shippers (\"Shipper(s)\") with carriers (\"Carrier(s)\") in the freight industry by providing Carriers with the ability to book a shipment, transportation management and other logistics services. Uber is also developing technologies designed to provide new solutions to solve everyday problems. Our technology is available in approximately 70 countries around the world, principally in the United States (\"U.S.\") and Canada, Latin America, Europe (excluding Russia), the Middle East, Africa, and Asia (excluding China and Southeast Asia).\\n\\n## Our Segments\\n\\nAs of December 31, 2023, we had three operating and reportable segments: Mobility, Delivery and Freight. Mobility, Delivery and Freight platform offerings each address large, fragmented markets. Mobility Our Mobility offering connects consumers with a wide range of transportation modalities, such as ridesharing, carsharing, micromobility, rentals, public transit, taxis, and more helping customers go almost anywhere they need. We believe our global leadership position and the vast amount of marketplace data that comes along with it means that we have the best technical and data platform to innovate faster than other companies with similar products. We believe our scale and global availability allows our Mobility segment to offer better consumer experiences to riders in a variety of vehicle types, providing consumers with higher reliability and Drivers with better earnings opportunities. Mobility also includes activity related to our financial partnerships products and advertising. We also participate in certain regions through our minority-owned entities.')]}\n",

We collect service fees and commissions from drivers for their use of our ridesharing marketplace. As drivers accept more rider leads, Gross Bookings¹ and Rides¹ increase, driving more revenue. We also generate revenue from riders renting Light Vehicles, drivers renting vehicles through Express Drive and by making our ridesharing marketplace available to organizations through our Lyft Business offerings, such as our Concierge and Lyft Pass programs. In 2021, we began generating revenues from licensing and data access agreements. In 2022, we began generating revenues from the sale of bikes and bike station software and hardware sales substantially through our acquisition of PBSC Urban Solutions Inc (\"PBSC\"). Riders and drivers want and value choice, and we believe there remains an opportunity for growth in our marketplace. In September 2023, we launched Women+ Connect, a new feature that offers women and nonbinary drivers the option to turn on a preference within the Lyft App to prioritize matches with nearby women and nonbinary riders. We are focused on delivering a great rideshare experience and will continue to innovate for drivers and riders, creating an increasingly differentiated service over time. We are committed to building a durable, healthy and profitable business for riders, drivers and shareholders.'), Document(metadata={'id': '2', 'source': 'gs://docs-10k/pdf/uber.pdf', 'company': 'Uber', 'type': '10-K', 'year': '2023', 'url': 'https://storage.cloud.google.com/docs-10k/pdf/uber.pdf', 'previous_segments': [], 'next_segments': [], 'relevance_score': 0.614560067653656}, page_content='# PART I\\n\\n## Our Platform\\n\\nWith our platform, we are making it even easier for our consumers to unlock convenience.

During November 2021, we launched Uber One in the United States as our single cross-platform membership program that brings together the best of Uber. Uber One members have access to discounts, special pricing, priority service, and exclusive perks across our rides, delivery and grocery offerings. Since then, we have expanded Uber One to approximately 25 countries. Our Eats Pass membership program continues to remain available in select cities as a subscription offering. Our membership programs are designed to make utilizing our suite of products a seamless and rewarding experience for our consumers. We exited 2023 with 19 million members for our Uber One, Eats Pass and Rides Pass membership programs. We are also utilizing our data and scale to offer marketplace-centric advertising to connect merchants and brands with our platform network and unlocking cross-platform advertising formats. During October 2022, we officially launched Uber\\'s advertising division and introduced Uber Journey Ads, an engaging way for brands to connect with consumers throughout the entire ride process. We now offer a model that enables brands to partner with Uber on a variety of advertising options on the Uber and Uber Eats apps, and beyond, while connecting with consumers in brand-safe and captivating ways. We also provide comprehensive reporting and analysis, which helps brands fine-tune their understanding of consumers and create more impactful campaigns as they connect with consumers at relevant points throughout their journeys and transactions. During the fourth quarter of 2023, active advertising merchants exceeded 550,000. We believe that our advertising further strengthens the power of our platform and will continue to do so as we onboard more advertisers.')]}\n",

We face significant competition in each of the mobility and delivery industries globally and in the logistics industry in the United States and Canada from existing, well-established, and low-cost alternatives, and in the future we expect to face competition from new market entrants given the low barriers to entry that characterize these industries. As we and our competitors introduce new products and offerings, and as existing products evolve, we expect to become subject to additional competition. While we work to expand globally and introduce new products and offerings across a range of industries, many of our competitors remain focused on a limited number of products or on a narrow geographic scope, allowing them to develop specialized expertise and employ resources in a more targeted manner than we do. The competition we face in each of our offerings includes: Mobility. Our Mobility offering competes with personal vehicle ownership and usage, which accounts for the majority of passenger miles in the markets that we serve, and traditional transportation services, including taxicab companies and taxi-hailing services, livery and other car services. In addition, public transportation can be a superior substitute to our Mobility offering and in many cases, offers a faster and lower-cost travel option in many cities. We also compete with other 5 • ridesharing companies, including certain of our minority-owned entities, for Drivers and Riders, including Lyft, Ola, Didi, and Bolt. Delivery. Our Delivery offering competes with numerous companies in the meal, grocery and other delivery space in various regions for drivers, consumers, and merchants, including Amazon, Deliveroo, Delivery Hero, DoorDash, iFood, Instacart, Just Eat Takeaway, and Rappi. Our Delivery offering also competes with restaurants, including those that offer their own delivery and/or take-away, meal kit delivery services, grocery delivery services, and traditional grocers.

We expect competition to continue, both from current competitors and new entrants in the market that may be well-established and enjoy greater resources or other strategic advantages. If we are unable to anticipate or successfully react to these competitive challenges in a timely manner, our competitive position could weaken, or fail to improve, and we could experience a decline in revenue or growth stagnation that could adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations. Our main ridesharing competitor in the United States and Canada is Uber, though we also compete with other ridesharing transportation network companies, and taxi cab and livery companies as well as traditional automotive manufacturers. Our main competitors in the bike and scooter sharing market include Lime, Bird, Fifteen and Tier. We also compete with other manufacturers of bike and scooter sharing equipment for sales of such equipment, particularly in markets outside of the United States. Additionally, there are other non-U.S.-based TaaS network companies, non-ridesharing transportation network companies and traditional automotive manufacturers that may expand into the United States and Canada. There are also a number of companies developing autonomous vehicle technology and TaaS offerings that may compete with us in the future, including Alphabet (Waymo), which is offering autonomous ride-hailing services in certain markets, Amazon (Zoox), Apple, Aurora, Baidu, General Motors (Cruise), Motional, and Tesla as well as many other technology companies and automobile manufacturers and suppliers. We anticipate continued challenges from current competitors as well as from new entrants into the TaaS market. We believe we can compete favorably. However, many of our competitors and potential competitors are larger and have greater brand name recognition, longer operating histories, larger marketing budgets and established marketing relationships, access to larger customer bases and significantly greater resources for the development of their offerings.

Trust is the foundation of our relationship with drivers and riders on our platform, and we take significant measures every day that are focused on their safety. To ensure we are delivering exceptional service levels and upholding high quality standards, we have established our Safety and Customer Care, or SCC, team as a key part of our organization. SCC is in charge of fielding safety and customer support inquiries and is available through multiple channels, including via self-service and assisted support directly within our apps. SCC aims to listen to customers, quickly resolve problems when they occur and maintain trust with drivers and riders. Some measures we take to promote the safety of riders and drivers on the platform include: Annual background checks and ongoing criminal monitoring. Every driver is required to pass a professionally administered criminal background check before they drive and each year after that. In the United States, continuous criminal monitoring allows us to quickly deactivate drivers with disqualifying criminal convictions. Similarly, in the United States, we also continuously check driving records so that we can promptly identify and remove drivers from the platform upon detection of a disqualifying violation. Share location. The Lyft App provides real-time ride tracking, so riders can share their exact location and route with family and friends. Once a user enables this feature, a user's trusted contacts (who they shared their location with) can see trip status and where they are on the map. Emergency help, supported by ADT. If a rider or driver feels uncomfortable or needs emergency assistance at any point, they are able to quickly connect with an ADT security professional through the Lyft App, silently or by voice. If someone signals they need help and subsequently does not respond to a call or text from ADT, ADT will contact 911 and share the user's location and other relevant information. Live safety support and specialized support and advocacy. Our Safety team is standing by, ready to help via phone or chat, and every member of the Safety team is a credentialed victim advocate. Each member has training in trauma-informed care. Smart trip check-in. We monitor rides for unusual activity, like long stops or route deviations, and in some instances, if we notice a ride irregularity, we reach out to riders and drivers directly. We will ask the rider or driver if they need help, and, if appropriate, connect them to emergency assistance or our own Safety team.\"), Document(metadata={'id': '2', 'source': 'gs://docs-10k/pdf/uber.pdf', 'company': 'Uber', 'type': '10-K', 'year': '2023', 'url': 'https://storage.cloud.google.com/docs-10k/pdf/uber.pdf', 'previous_segments': [], 'next_segments': [], 'relevance_score': 0.7242432236671448}, page_content='# PART I\\n\\n## Government Regulation\\n\\nWe operate in a particularly complex legal and regulatory environment.

Our platform, and in particular our Mobility products, are subject to differing, and sometimes conflicting, laws, rules, and regulations in the numerous jurisdictions in which we operate. A large number of proposals are before various national, regional, and local legislative bodies and regulatory entities, both within the United States and in foreign jurisdictions, regarding issues related to our business model. In the United States, many state and local laws, rules, and regulations impose legal restrictions and other requirements on operating our Mobility products, including licensing, insurance, screening, and background check requirements. Outside of the United States, certain jurisdictions have adopted similar laws, rules, and regulations while other jurisdictions have not adopted any laws, rules, and regulations which govern our Mobility business. Further, certain jurisdictions, including Argentina, Germany, Italy, Japan, South Korea, and Spain, six countries that we have identified as expansion markets, have adopted laws, rules, and regulations banning certain ridesharing products or imposing extensive operational restrictions. This uncertainty and fragmented regulatory environment creates significant complexities for our business and operating model. In addition, our Delivery and Freight products are also subject to laws, regulations and standards that govern the transportation of food, alcohol and other goods. Substantially all states in the United States and numerous municipalities in the United States and around the world have adopted Transportation Network Company (\"TNC\") regulations. These regulations generally focus on companies that operate websites or mobile apps that connect individual drivers with their own vehicles to passengers willing to pay to be driven to their destinations.

Further, changes in corporate spending, including cost-cuts and layoffs, may adversely impact business travel, commuting and other business-related expenditures and impact our Lyft Business customers. In addition, uncertainty and volatility in the banking and financial services sectors, inflation and higher interest rates, increased fuel and other energy costs, increased labor and benefits costs and increased insurance costs have, and may continue to, put pressure on economic conditions, which has led, and could lead, to greater operating expenses. For example, inflation has increased and is expected to further increase medical costs and vehicle repair costs, including increased prices of new and used vehicle parts, which has resulted in increases in our insurance costs. Similarly, these factors, as well as increased fuel costs, increase our costs as well as costs for drivers on our platform.

Further, we may need to make changes to our business to respond to these conditions and be able to compete effectively. For example, as a result of the increase in gas prices at certain points in 2022, in order to support drivers on our platform, we implemented a temporary per ride fuel surcharge in most markets, which we removed in September 2022. Similarly, we have adjusted our pricing in response to competitive pressures caused by changes in our marketplace, which has in the past contributed to a decline in our revenue and may cause a decline in revenue in future quarters.

A deterioration of general macroeconomic conditions, including slower growth or recession, inflation and higher interest rates, or decreases in consumer spending power may harm our results of operations. For example, inflation has increased and is expected to increase our insurance costs. Consumer preferences tend to shift to lower-cost alternatives during recessionary periods and other periods in which disposable income is adversely affected. In such circumstances, consumers may choose to use one of our lower price-point products over a higher Gross Bookings per Trip offering, may choose to forgo our offerings for lower-cost personal vehicle or public transportation alternatives, or may reduce total miles traveled as economic activity decreases. Such a shift in consumer behavior may reduce our network liquidity and may harm our business, financial condition, and operating results. Likewise, small businesses that do not have substantial resources, including many of the merchants in our network, tend to be more adversely affected by poor economic conditions than large businesses. Further, because spending for food purchases from merchants is generally considered discretionary, any decline in consumer spending may have a disproportionate effect on our Delivery offering. If spending at many of the merchants in our network declines, or if a significant number of these merchants go out of business, consumers may be less likely to use our products and offerings, which could harm our business and operating results. Alternatively, if economic conditions improve, it could lead to Drivers obtaining additional or alternative opportunities for work, which could negatively impact the number of Drivers on our platform, and thereby reduce our network liquidity. Increases in fuel, food, labor, energy, and other costs due to inflation and other factors could adversely affect our operating results. 28')]}\n",

Additionally, the recovery of demand for our platform and the impact of the broader economic environment on rider and driver behavior varies by geography and certain markets where we have historically seen significant demand have been, and may continue to be, slow to recover or grow. Driver behaviors also shifted throughout the COVID-19 pandemic, leading to imbalanced levels of driver availability on our platform relative to rider demand at times in certain markets. Limited driver availability has negatively impacted service levels, which led us to provide additional incentives to attract and retain drivers, and has also decreased demand for vehicles rented to drivers through our Express Drive program. We, along with many other employers, modified our business practices as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic, many of which have continued in the post-pandemic environment. We have permitted corporate employees in nearly all of our locations to work in a hybrid in-office and remote environment, limited employee travel, and shifted toward holding virtual events and meetings. These shifts have led us to reduce our real estate footprint and may increase the risk of a cybersecurity breach or incident, result in decreased productivity, harm our company culture, adversely affect our ability to timely and accurately report our financial statements or maintain internal controls, or otherwise negatively affect our business, our financial condition and results of operations could be adversely affected.

Of particular note are proceedings in California, where on May 5, 2020, the California Attorney General, in conjunction with the city attorneys for San Francisco, Los Angeles and San Diego, filed a complaint in San Francisco Superior Court (the \"Court\") against Uber and Lyft, Inc., alleging that drivers are misclassified, and sought an injunction and monetary damages related to the alleged competitive advantage caused by the alleged misclassification of drivers. To comply with Proposition 22, we have incurred and expect to incur additional expenses, including expenses associated with a guaranteed minimum earnings floor for Drivers, insurance for injury protection and subsidies for health care. We do not expect these changes will have a material impact on our business, results of operations, financial position, or cash flows. If, as a result of legislation or judicial decisions, we are required to classify Drivers as employees, workers or quasi-employees where those statuses exist, we would incur significant additional expenses for compensating Drivers, including expenses associated with the application of wage and hour laws (including minimum wage, overtime, and meal and rest period requirements), employee benefits, social security contributions, taxes (direct and indirect), and potential penalties.

To the extent any strategies, initiatives or modifications to our pricing methodologies lead to real or perceived harm to driver earnings, our ability to attract or retain qualified drivers may be adversely affected. Any of the foregoing actions may not ultimately be successful in attracting and retaining qualified drivers and riders or may result in loss of market share, negative public perception and harm to our reputation. While we continue to maintain that drivers on our platform are independent contractors in legal and administrative proceedings, our arguments may ultimately be unsuccessful. A determination in, resolution of, or settlement of, any legal proceeding, whether we are party to such legal proceeding or not, that classifies a driver utilizing a ridesharing platform as an employee, may require us to revise our pricing and earnings methodologies to account for such a change to driver classification. Proposition 22 in California, HB 2076 in Washington and an agreement with the New York Attorney General have enabled us to provide additional earning opportunities to drivers in those states, including guaranteed earnings. The transition has required, and will continue to require, additional costs and we expect to face other challenges as we transition drivers to these new models, including changes to our pricing. We have also tested or launched, and may in the future test or launch, certain changes to the rates, fees and payment structure for drivers on our platform, which may not ultimately be successful in attracting and retaining qualified drivers. Moreover, successful litigation to overturn Proposition 22, litigation over Lyft's compliance with Proposition 22, or the reclassification of drivers on our platform as employees could reduce the available supply of drivers as drivers leave the platform due to the changes in flexibility under an employment model. While we do and will attempt to optimize ride prices and balance supply and demand in our ridesharing marketplace, our assessments may not be accurate. We have experienced in the past and may experience in the future underpricing or overpricing of our offerings due to changes we make to the technology used in our pricing. In addition, if the offerings on our platform change, then we may need to revise our pricing methodologies.

We expect competition to continue, both from current competitors and new entrants in the market that may be well-established and enjoy greater resources or other strategic advantages. If we are unable to anticipate or successfully react to these competitive challenges in a timely manner, our competitive position could weaken, or fail to improve, and we could experience a decline in revenue or growth stagnation that could adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations.

Our main competitors in the bike and scooter sharing market include Lime, Bird, Fifteen and Tier. We also compete with other manufacturers of bike and scooter sharing equipment for sales of such equipment, particularly in markets outside of the United States. Additionally, there are other non-U.S.-based TaaS network companies, non-ridesharing transportation network companies and traditional automotive manufacturers that may expand into the United States and Canada.

In addition, within each of these markets, the cost to switch between products is low. Consumers have a propensity to shift to the lowest-cost or highest-quality provider; Drivers have a propensity to shift to the platform with the highest earnings potential; restaurants and other merchants have a propensity to shift to the delivery platform that offers the lowest service fee for their meals and other goods and provides the highest volume of orders; and Shippers and Carriers have a propensity to shift to the platform with the best price and most convenient service for hauling shipments. Further, while we work to expand globally and introduce new products and offerings across a range of industries, many of our competitors remain focused on a limited number of products or on a narrow geographic scope, allowing them to develop specialized expertise and employ resources in a more targeted manner than we do.

Many factors, including operating costs, legal and regulatory requirements or constraints and our current and future competitors' pricing and marketing strategies including increased incentives for drivers, could significantly affect our pricing strategies. Certain of our competitors offer, or may in the future offer, lower-priced or a broader range of offerings. Similarly, certain competitors may use marketing strategies that enable them to attract or retain qualified drivers and riders at a lower cost than we do. This includes the use of algorithms to set dynamic prices for riders and earnings for drivers that are dependent on various factors, such as the route, time of day, and pick-up and drop-off locations of riders. From time to time, we have made pricing changes and spent significant amounts on marketing and both rider and driver incentives, and we expect that, from time to time, we will be required, through competition, regulation or otherwise, to reduce the price of rides for riders, increase the incentives we pay to drivers on our platform or reduce the fees we charge the drivers on our platform, or to increase our marketing and other expenses to attract and retain qualified drivers and riders in response to competitive pressures. These actions may adversely affect our business and financial results and may not have the desired benefits. At times, in certain geographic markets, we have offered, and may continue to offer, driver incentives that cause the total amount of the fare that a driver retains, combined with the driver incentives a driver receives from us, to increase, at times meeting or exceeding the amount of gross bookings we generate for a given ride. Furthermore, the economic sensitivity of drivers and riders on our platform may vary by geographic location, and as we expand, our pricing methodologies may not enable us to compete effectively in these locations. Local regulations may affect our pricing in certain geographic locations, which could amplify these effects. For example, state and local laws and regulations regarding pricing limitations during a government declared State of Emergency have imposed limits on prices for certain services, and state and local laws and regulations have imposed minimum earnings standards for drivers, which, at times, have caused us to increase prices in certain markets, including California, New York and Washington.

These activities may not be successful, and any negative outcomes could adversely affect our business, operations, financial condition and results of operations. Our industry is increasingly regulated. We have been subject to intense regulatory pressure from state, provincial and municipal regulatory authorities across the United States and Canada, and a number of them have imposed limitations on ridesharing and bike and scooter sharing, and certain jurisdictions have adopted rules governing minimum driver earnings for ridesharing platforms. Other jurisdictions in which we currently operate or may want to operate have and could continue to consider legislation regulating driver earnings. We could also face similar regulatory restrictions from foreign regulators as we expand operations internationally, particularly in areas where we face competition from local incumbents. In addition, we may face regulations relating to new or developing technologies. For example, the European Commission has proposed the EU Artificial Intelligence Act, which would impose operational and regulatory requirements relating to the use of AI technologies, and other jurisdictions may adopt laws and regulations relating to AI. Adverse changes in laws or regulations at all levels of government or bans on or material limitations to our offerings could adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations.')]}\n",
      "What are the business risk factors associated with ridesharing companies like Uber and Lyft, and how do these factors impact their market performance?\n",
      "{'response': AIMessage(content=\"Based on the provided 10-K excerpts from Uber (2023) and Lyft (2023), several key business risk factors are evident for ridesharing companies:\\n\\n**International Expansion Risks (Uber):**  Uber's significant reliance on international markets (77% of Trips as of December 31, 2023) exposes it to substantial risks. These include:\\n\\n* **Operational and Compliance Challenges:**  Difficulties stemming from language barriers, cultural differences, and varying legal and regulatory landscapes across different countries.  This includes navigating diverse laws related to competition, pricing, payment methods, transportation services, data privacy, and intellectual property.\\n* **Localization Costs:**  The substantial investment required to adapt the platform and operations to local practices, laws, and regulations in each market.\\n* **Competition:** Facing competition from local companies with better market understanding and pre-existing relationships, as well as potentially favorable treatment from government authorities.\\n* **Currency Fluctuations and Payment Risks:**  Exposure to exchange rate volatility and challenges in managing payments, particularly in markets where cash transactions are prevalent or where regulations governing local currencies impact fare collection and remittance to drivers.  Increased credit risk and payment fraud are also mentioned.\\n* **Acquisition Risks:** The success of acquisitions like Careem and Cornershop is not guaranteed and could negatively impact operating results.\\n\\n\\n**Evolving Business Model and Market Dynamics (Lyft):** Lyft highlights risks associated with its evolving business model and the dynamic nature of the ridesharing industry:\\n\\n* **Forecasting Challenges:** Difficulty in accurately predicting gross bookings, revenue, and operating results, and effectively managing expenses in a rapidly changing environment.\\n* **Driver and Rider Acquisition and Retention:**  The ongoing challenge of attracting and retaining qualified drivers and riders cost-effectively.\\n* **Pricing and Regulatory Compliance:**  The need to effectively price services competitively while complying with existing and evolving laws and regulations.\\n* **Managing Assets and Expenses:**  The need to efficiently manage platform operations, assets, and expenses in response to economic and market changes, including shifts in rider behavior and demand.\\n* **Capital Expenditures and Supply Chain:**  Managing capital expenditures for current and future offerings, including vehicle networks, and effectively managing supply chain relationships.\\n* **Macroeconomic and Market Changes:**  Responding to macroeconomic shifts and changes in market dynamics.\\n* **Growth and Operational Management:**  Effectively managing growth and business operations, including the impact of unforeseen events like pandemics.\\n* **Geographic Expansion and International Operations:**  Successfully expanding geographically and managing international operations.\\n* **Innovation and Development:**  Successfully developing new platform features and services to enhance user experience.\\n\\n\\n**Impact on Market Performance:** These risk factors can significantly impact the market performance of both companies.  For example, difficulties in international expansion (Uber) or challenges in managing a rapidly evolving business model (Lyft) could lead to lower-than-expected revenue, increased costs, and reduced profitability.  Regulatory changes or intense competition could also negatively affect market share and pricing power.

Our environmental impact also gives drivers and riders another great reason to choose Lyft, and is an intrinsic part of how we think about 10 our business goals. We are working to make the Lyft Platform more sustainable by helping drivers transition to EVs, riders take more sustainable modes, and businesses reduce their carbon footprint. The rides that we facilitate on our platform make up over 95% of Lyft's carbon emissions. Transitioning these rides from gas-powered to electric vehicles is the one of the best ways we can contribute long-term toward a cleaner planet. Over 8 million riders rode in an EV in 2023. Rides in electric vehicles generally get higher ratings and tips compared to rides in hybrids and gas cars. Over 20% of rides on the Lyft Platform are currently in a hybrid or an EV. In April 2023, we launched Green, where riders can select an EV or hybrid vehicle, specifically for business travelers, and in January 2024, we expanded Green to nearly 40 airports in North America. Because we stand at a pivotal moment in the fight against climate change, Lyft strives to grow EVs on the platform. In 2020, we made a commitment to reach 100% EVs across the Lyft Platform by the end of 2030. We still believe in the long-term transition to EVs, but now do not see a path to completing our transition to 100% EVs by 2030 given the current EV landscape. Over the course of 2024 and 2025, we will invest an additional $80 million total to support EV drivers and encourage gas-powered drivers to make the switch.

For example, in January 2021, we completed the merger of our autonomous technologies business with Aurora, and included a $400 million investment in the combined company and a commercial agreement pursuant to which we and Aurora will collaborate with respect to the launch and commercialization of self- driving vehicles on our ridesharing network. We believe that autonomous vehicle technologies may have the ability to meaningfully impact the industries in which we compete and that autonomous vehicles present substantial opportunities. Several companies other than Aurora, including Waymo, Cruise Automation, Tesla, Apple, Zoox (which Amazon has acquired), Aptiv, and Nuro, are developing autonomous vehicle technologies, either alone or through collaborations with car manufacturers, and we expect that they will use such technology to further compete with us in the mobility, delivery, or logistics industries. Waymo has already introduced a commercialized ridehailing fleet of autonomous vehicles, and it is possible that our competitors could introduce autonomous vehicle offerings earlier than we will be able to offer autonomous vehicles on our platform through our commercial agreement with Aurora or other partners. In the event that our competitors bring autonomous vehicles to market before we are able to offer autonomous vehicles on our platform, or their technology is or is perceived to be superior to the technology of parties with which we partner to offer autonomous vehicles on our platform, they may be able to leverage such technology to compete more effectively with us, which would adversely impact our financial performance and our prospects. For example, use of autonomous vehicles could substantially reduce the cost of providing ridesharing, delivery, or logistics services, which could allow competitors to offer such services at a substantially lower price as compared to the price available to consumers on our platform. If a significant number of consumers choose to use our competitors' offerings over ours, our financial performance and prospects would be adversely impacted. Autonomous vehicle technologies involve significant risks and liabilities. Collisions, including fatal collisions, have happened. Failures of autonomous vehicle technologies that we may offer on our platform or crashes involving autonomous vehicles using the technology of our partners, could generate substantial liability for us, create negative publicity about us, or result in regulatory scrutiny, all of which would have an adverse effect on our reputation, brand, business, prospects, and operating results.\")]}\n",

We are involved in numerous legal proceedings globally, including putative class and collective class action lawsuits, demands for arbitration, charges and claims before administrative agencies, and investigations or audits by labor, social security, and tax authorities that claim that Drivers should be treated as our employees (or as workers or quasi-employees where those statuses exist), rather than as independent contractors. We believe that Drivers are independent contractors because, among other things, they can choose whether, when, and where to provide services on our platform, are free to provide services on our competitors' platforms, and provide a vehicle to perform services on our platform. Nevertheless, we may not be successful in defending the classification of Drivers in some or all jurisdictions. Furthermore, the costs associated with defending, settling, or resolving pending and future lawsuits (including demands for arbitration) relating to the classification of Drivers have been and may continue to be material to our business. In addition, more than 150,000 Drivers in the United States who have entered into arbitration agreements with us have filed (or expressed an intention to file) arbitration demands against us that assert similar classification claims. We have resolved the classification claims of a majority of these Drivers under individual settlement agreements. Furthermore, we are involved in numerous legal proceedings regarding the enforceability of arbitration agreements entered into with Drivers. If we are not successful in such proceedings, this could negatively impact the enforceability of arbitration agreements in other legal proceedings, which could have an adverse consequence on our business and financial condition. Changes to foreign, state, and local laws governing the definition or classification of independent contractors, or judicial decisions regarding independent contractor classification, could require classification of Drivers as employees (or workers or quasi-employees where those statuses exist) and/or representation of Drivers by labor unions. For example, California's Assembly Bill 5 became 11 effective as of January 1, 2020.

We can\\'t talk about work that serves customer needs and social goals without mentioning our responsibility to our shared environment - the air we breathe and the resilience of communities we serve. We\\'re working to make the Lyft Platform more sustainable by helping drivers transition to electric vehicles (“EVs”), riders take more sustainable transportation modes, and businesses reduce their carbon footprint. We\\'ve achieved significant growth in EV rides on our platform by investing in EV driver incentives, expanding the Express Drive EV rental program, helping drivers access discounted fast charging and advocating for smart EV policy. We believe many users are loyal to Lyft because of our values, brand and commitment to social and environmental responsibility. Our values, brand and focus on customer experience are key differentiators for our business. We continue to believe that users are increasingly choosing services, including a transportation network, based on brand affinity and value alignment and we aim to make it easy for both drivers and riders to choose Lyft every time.\\n\\n### Our Transportation Network\\n\\nOur transportation network is primarily comprised of: Ridesharing Marketplace. Our core offering connects drivers with riders. The scale of our network enables us to predict demand and proactively incentivize drivers to be available for rides in the right place at the right time. This allows us to optimize earning opportunities for drivers and offer convenient rides for riders, creating sustainable value to both sides of our marketplace. Our ridesharing marketplace connects drivers with riders in cities across the United States and in select cities in Canada. In addition to our standard rideshare offering, riders can select a variety of other rideshare offerings which include, but are not limited to, Wait & Save, Priority Pickup, XL, Extra Comfort and Black. 1 Beginning in the third quarter of 2023, we began presenting Gross Bookings and Rides as our key business metrics, which we believe best align with how management assesses our performance and measures achievement against our strategic priorities and opportunities.

We believe that Drivers are independent contractors because, among other things, they can choose whether, when, and where to provide services on our platform, are free to provide services on our competitors' platforms, and provide a vehicle to perform services on our platform. Nevertheless, we may not be successful in defending the classification of Drivers in some or all jurisdictions. Furthermore, the costs associated with defending, settling, or resolving pending and future lawsuits (including demands for arbitration) relating to the classification of Drivers have been and may continue to be material to our business. In addition, more than 150,000 Drivers in the United States who have entered into arbitration agreements with us have filed (or expressed an intention to file) arbitration demands against us that assert similar classification claims. We have resolved the classification claims of a majority of these Drivers under individual settlement agreements. Furthermore, we are involved in numerous legal proceedings regarding the enforceability of arbitration agreements entered into with Drivers. If we are not successful in such proceedings, this could negatively impact the enforceability of arbitration agreements in other legal proceedings, which could have an adverse consequence on our business and financial condition. Changes to foreign, state, and local laws governing the definition or classification of independent contractors, or judicial decisions regarding independent contractor classification, could require classification of Drivers as employees (or workers or quasi-employees where those statuses exist) and/or representation of Drivers by labor unions. For example, California's Assembly Bill 5 became 11 effective as of January 1, 2020. Government authorities and private plaintiffs have brought litigation asserting that Assembly Bill 5 requires Drivers in California to be classified as employees. In November 2020, California voters approved Proposition 22, a California state ballot initiative that provides a framework for drivers that use platforms like ours for independent work. Proposition 22 went into effect in December 2020 and we expect that Drivers will be able to maintain their status as independent contractors under California law and that we and our competitors will be required to comply with the provisions of Proposition 22. Although our stipulation to dissolve the California Attorney General's preliminary injunction was granted in April 2021, that litigation remains pending, and we also may face liability relating to periods before the effective date of Proposition 22. Legal challenges, including constitutional challenges, to Proposition 22 have been and may continue to be filed.\"), Document(metadata={'id': '1', 'source': 'gs://docs-10k/pdf/lyft.pdf', 'company': 'lyft', 'type': '10-K', 'year': '2023', 'url': 'https://storage.cloud.google.com/docs-10k/pdf/lyft.pdf', 'previous_segments': [], 'next_segments': [], 'relevance_score': 0.7148234844207764}, page_content='# Challenges to contractor classification of drivers that use our platform may have adverse business, financial, tax, legal and other consequences to our business.\\n\\nIn addition to the harms listed above, a determination in, resolution of, or settlement of, any legal proceeding related to driver classification matters may require us to significantly alter our existing business model and/or operations (including suspending or ceasing operations in impacted jurisdictions), increase our costs and impact our ability to add qualified drivers to our platform and grow our business, which could have an adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations and our ability to achieve or maintain profitability in the future.

      "{'response': AIMessage(content=\"Based on the provided 10-K excerpts, several business risk factors impact the operational performance of ridesharing companies like Lyft and Uber:\\n\\n**Lyft's Risk Factors:**\\n\\n* **Operational Challenges:** Lyft faces risks related to its limited operating history, achieving and maintaining profitability, competition, attracting and retaining drivers and riders, insurance coverage and claims, managing growth, and dealing with user support and fraud.  The success of its Express Drive program and nascent advertising business (Lyft Media) are also uncertain.  Technological risks include reliance on third-party providers (like AWS), potential security breaches, and defects in its technology or that of its partners.  The accuracy of its key metrics and estimates is also a concern.  Finally,  changes in mobile technology and the interoperability of its platform with third-party applications pose challenges.\\n\\n* **Personnel and Legal Risks:**  Lyft's reliance on key personnel and its ability to attract and retain them is a risk factor.  So too are legal issues related to intellectual property and illegal or improper activity by platform users.  The accuracy of driver background checks, conducted by third-party providers, is also a concern.\\n\\n* **Expansion Risks:**  Lyft's presence outside the United States and any future international expansion present additional risks.\\n\\n\\n**Uber's Risk Factors:**\\n\\n* **International Operations:** Uber's significant dependence on international markets (77% of Trips as of December 31, 2023) exposes it to substantial risks. These include operational and compliance challenges due to cultural and language differences, the need for significant investment in localization, navigating more restrictive laws and regulations in various countries, competition from local companies with better market understanding, differing levels of brand acceptance and technological compatibility, exposure to potentially improper business practices, legal uncertainty regarding liability for platform users' actions, difficulties in managing international operations (including labor relations), currency exchange rate fluctuations, and challenges related to cash transactions and local currency regulations.  The success of acquisitions like Careem and Cornershop is also uncertain.\\n\\n\\n**Impact on Operational Performance:**\\n\\nThe identified risk factors can significantly impact operational performance in several ways:\\n\\n* **Reduced Profitability:**  Competition, driver/rider acquisition and retention challenges, insurance costs, and operational inefficiencies can all negatively affect profitability.\\n\\n* **Increased Costs:**  Investments in technology, international expansion, and addressing legal and regulatory compliance add to operational costs.\\n\\n* **Reputational Damage:** Security breaches, driver misconduct, or negative publicity can damage brand reputation, leading to decreased ridership and driver sign-ups.\\n\\n* **Operational Disruptions:**  System failures, security breaches, or regulatory issues can disrupt operations, leading to service interruptions and lost revenue.\\n\\n* **Legal and Regulatory Risks:**  Failure to comply with local laws and regulations can result in fines, penalties, and operational restrictions.\\n\\n\\nIt's important to note that this analysis is based solely on the provided 10-K excerpts.

Based on the provided 2023 10-K reports for Uber,  a breach can lead to:\\n\\n* **Legal Liability:**  Breaches expose the company to liability under various laws and regulations across multiple jurisdictions. This increases the risk of litigation and governmental investigations (Uber's 10-K mentions inquiries, investigations, and requests for information from the DOJ, state Attorney General offices, and other U.S. and foreign government agencies).  The Lyft 10-K also highlights the potential for regulatory investigations, private claims, and litigation following a breach.\\n\\n* **Financial Penalties and Costs:**  Responding to and mitigating the effects of a breach requires significant capital and resources.  This includes costs associated with notifying affected parties, investigating the root cause, and defending against resulting lawsuits.  Both Uber and Lyft's 10-Ks mention the potential for significant financial exposure.  Uber's report specifically notes potential loss of revenue and harm to its brand.  Lyft's report adds the possibility of increased card processing fees and loss of driver or rider confidence.\\n\\n* **Reputational Damage:**  A security breach can severely harm a company's reputation and brand, potentially leading to decreased customer trust and reduced usage of the platform. Both Uber and Lyft's 10-Ks explicitly mention reputational harm as a consequence of a security incident.\\n\\n* **Operational Disruption:**  Breaches can interrupt operations, making the platform unavailable or otherwise disrupted.  Lyft's 10-K highlights this potential disruption.\\n\\n* **Insurance Coverage Uncertainty:**  Both companies acknowledge uncertainty regarding the adequacy of their insurance coverage for such liabilities, the continued availability of insurance on reasonable terms, and the possibility of insurers denying coverage for future claims.  This adds to the overall financial risk.\\n\\n\\nIn summary, cybersecurity incidents for companies like Uber and Lyft represent a multifaceted risk encompassing legal, financial, reputational, and operational challenges.

The document highlights several key areas:\\n\\n* **Regulatory Compliance:**  Lyft faces potential negative impacts from changes in laws or regulations related to privacy, data protection, and the transfer of personal data.  Failure to comply could harm its business.  The expansion of offerings (like Lyft Media and Lyft Pass for Healthcare) increases exposure to new regulations, including HIPAA compliance, which carries substantial financial penalties for breaches.  These compliance costs are significant and ongoing.\\n\\n* **Third-Party Reliance (implied):** While not explicitly stated regarding background checks, the document's focus on data privacy and security regulations and the substantial penalties for non-compliance strongly implies that reliance on third-party providers for background checks introduces additional risk.  A failure by these third-party providers to adequately conduct background checks or disclose relevant information could lead to legal action and reputational damage, impacting Lyft's competitive standing.  The Uber 10-K excerpt supports this, explicitly mentioning that third-party background checks may not reveal all relevant information and may be inadequate, leading to potential legal action.\\n\\n* **Competitive Disadvantage:**  The substantial costs associated with complying with data privacy and security regulations, coupled with the potential for significant penalties from non-compliance, create a competitive disadvantage.

In relation to those individuals who earn income on our platform, Uber is one of the largest open platforms for work in the world, providing accessible, flexible work in approximately 70 countries. Drivers are key parts of the marketplaces that Uber has created through its apps. A diverse set of people choose to use our platform to earn income without having to apply for, or work the fixed 8 schedules associated with, traditional employment. We believe this flexibility is an improvement over traditional work schedules and is something we believe can and should remain available to anyone who chooses platform-based work. Uber monitors regional and global driver attraction, retention and satisfaction rates. Accessible, flexible, independent work has offered an option for many workers historically marginalized from the labor market and has enabled wide geographic coverage and reliable service offerings for consumers. However, it is increasingly clear that more can be done to improve the experience of using an app to connect with work opportunities. Although the situation varies across countries and cities, the benefits and protections for independent workers are generally patchy compared with those that employees receive. The current binary system of employment classification under some legal frameworks means that a worker is either an employee who is provided significant social benefits or an independent worker who has access to relatively few. This does not have to be the case. At Uber, we believe that being your own boss should not have to come at the expense of security and dignity in work. Around the world, Uber has found innovative ways to address these issues. • Advocacy: We have advocated for wider policy solutions to improve access to protections and benefits for independent workers. We believe all work should be treated equally. We also believe that legislative reform is needed to modernize the social safety net. This includes requiring Uber and other app based companies to provide benefits and protections to their users without compromising the flexibility of their use of the app. Some examples of our advocacy to preserve flexibility of work while expanding access to benefits and protections are as follows: In Washington State, we welcomed a new law that preserves rideshare driver independence and confers new benefits such as minimum earnings guarantee, injury protection and paid sick leave. In Chile, the legislature passed a law that incorporates platform workers into the government's healthcare and pensions scheme and introduces new requirements for platform companies such as minimum earnings guarantee for time spent actively working, maintain on-app insurance coverage, and provide couriers with safety equipment. Protections and benefits: We partner with leading insurance companies around the world to pioneer protections for independent workers.\"), Document(metadata={'id': '1', 'source': 'gs://docs-10k/pdf/lyft.pdf', 'company': 'lyft', 'type': '10-K', 'year': '2023', 'url': 'https://storage.cloud.google.com/docs-10k/pdf/lyft.pdf', 'previous_segments': [], 'next_segments': [], 'relevance_score': 0.5563481450080872}, page_content=\"# Changes to our pricing could adversely affect our ability to attract or retain qualified drivers and riders.\\n\\nWe have also modified, and expect to in the future modify, existing pricing methodologies, such as our up-front pricing policy.

Any of the foregoing actions may not ultimately be successful in attracting and retaining qualified drivers and riders or may result in loss of market share, negative public perception and harm to our reputation. While we continue to maintain that drivers on our platform are independent contractors in legal and administrative proceedings, our arguments may ultimately be unsuccessful. A determination in, resolution of, or settlement of, any legal proceeding, whether we are party to such legal proceeding or not, that classifies a driver utilizing a ridesharing platform as an employee, may require us to revise our pricing and earnings methodologies to account for such a change to driver classification. Proposition 22 in California, HB 2076 in Washington and an agreement with the New York Attorney General have enabled us to provide additional earning opportunities to drivers in those states, including guaranteed earnings. The transition has required, and will continue to require, additional costs and we expect to face other challenges as we transition drivers to these new models, including changes to our pricing. We have also tested or launched, and may in the future test or launch, certain changes to the rates, fees and payment structure for drivers on our platform, which may not ultimately be successful in attracting and retaining qualified drivers. Moreover, successful litigation to overturn Proposition 22, litigation over Lyft's compliance with Proposition 22, or the reclassification of drivers on our platform as employees could reduce the available supply of drivers as drivers leave the platform due to the changes in flexibility under an employment model.

These include individual, multiple plaintiff, and putative class and class action claims for alleged violation of laws related to, among other things, transportation, competition, advertising, consumer protection, fee calculations, personal injuries, privacy, intellectual property, product liability, discrimination, safety, and employment. For example, in May 2019, a class action was filed against us and certain of our subsidiaries in the Supreme Court of Victoria, Australia on behalf of participants in the taxi, hire-car, limousine, and charter vehicle industry who were licensed to operate in particular regions of Australia during certain periods between April 2014 and August 2017.

The company mentions California's regulation requiring 90% of rideshare miles to be in zero-emission vehicles by 2030, impacting their operations and potentially driver availability.  Driver supply constraints due to climate-related policies (like London's Congestion Charge Zone) could necessitate increased driver incentives.\\n\\n\\n**In summary:**  Both Lyft and Uber highlight the significant impact of climate change on their operations in California and elsewhere.  These impacts include increased operational costs, regulatory pressures to adopt EVs, and the risk of disruptions from extreme weather events.

Any of these risks could cause us to lose our ability to accept online payments or other payment transactions or make timely payments to drivers on our platform, any of which could make our platform less convenient and attractive to users and adversely affect our ability to attract and retain qualified drivers and riders. Nearly all rider payments and driver payouts are made by credit card, debit card or through third-party payment services, which subjects us to certain payment network or service provider operating rules, to certain regulations and to the risk of fraud. We may in the future offer new payment options to riders that may be subject to additional operating rules, regulations and risks. We may also be subject to a number of other laws and regulations relating to the payments we accept from riders, including with respect to money laundering, money transfers, privacy, data protection and information security. If we fail to comply with applicable rules and regulations, we may be subject to civil or criminal penalties, fines or higher transaction fees and may lose our ability to accept online payments or other payment card transactions, which could make our offerings less convenient and attractive to riders. If any of these events were to occur, our business, financial condition and results of operations could be adversely affected.')]}\n",

These limitations include the following: • Adjusted EBITDA excludes certain recurring, non-cash charges, such as depreciation of property and equipment and amortization of intangible assets, and although these are non-cash charges, the assets being depreciated and amortized may have to be replaced in the future, and Adjusted EBITDA does not reflect all cash capital expenditure requirements for such replacements or for new capital expenditure requirements; • Adjusted EBITDA excludes stock-based compensation expense, which has been, and will continue to be for the foreseeable future, a significant recurring expense in our business and an important part of our compensation strategy; • Adjusted EBITDA excludes certain restructuring and related charges, part of which may be settled in cash; • Adjusted EBITDA excludes other items not indicative of our ongoing operating performance; • Adjusted EBITDA does not reflect period-to-period changes in taxes, income tax expense or the cash necessary to pay income taxes; Adjusted EBITDA does not reflect the components of other income (expense), net, which primarily includes: interest income; foreign currency exchange gains (losses), net; gain (loss) on business divestitures, net; unrealized gain (loss) on debt and equity securities, net; and impairment of debt and equity securities; and Adjusted EBITDA excludes certain legal, tax, and regulatory reserve changes and settlements that may reduce cash available to us. 61 The following table presents a reconciliation of net income (loss) attributable to Uber Technologies, Inc., the most directly comparable GAAP financial measure, to Adjusted EBITDA for each of the periods indicated:'), Document(metadata={'id': '1', 'source': 'gs://docs-10k/pdf/lyft.pdf', 'company': 'lyft', 'type': '10-K', 'year': '2023', 'url': 'https://storage.cloud.google.com/docs-10k/pdf/lyft.pdf', 'previous_segments': [], 'next_segments': [], 'relevance_score': 0.7554156184196472}, page_content='# Gross Bookings and Adjusted EBITDA margin (calculated as a percentage of Gross Bookings)\\n\\nGross Bookings is a key indicator of the scale and impact of our overall platform. We define Gross Bookings as the total dollar value of transactions invoiced to rideshare riders including any applicable taxes, tolls and fees, excluding tips to drivers. Gross Bookings also includes amounts invoiced for other offerings, including but not limited to: Express Drive vehicle rentals, bike and scooter rentals, and amounts recognized for subscriptions, bike and bike station hardware and software sales, media, sponsorships, partnerships, and licensing and data access agreements. Adjusted EBITDA margin (calculated as a percentage of Gross Bookings) is calculated by dividing Adjusted EBITDA for a period by Gross Bookings for the same period. For the definition of Adjusted EBITDA, refer to “Non-GAAP Financial Measures”. The increase in Gross Bookings in the year ended December 31, 2023 as compared to the year ended December 31, 2022 was due primarily to Rides growth which benefited from improvements in marketplace health driven by our competitive pricing adjustments in addition to our focused execution. 56 The improvements in net loss as a percentage of Gross Bookings and Adjusted EBITDA margin (calculated as a percentage of Gross Bookings) in the year ended December 31, 2023 as compared to the year ended December 31, 2022 were due primarily to our cost-restructuring efforts in the first half of the year which helped us to partially offset the impact of competitive pricing to net loss and Adjusted EBITDA. Additionally, our net loss in the year ended December 31, 2022 included a $135.7 million impairment charge related to a non-marketable equity investment in a privately held company and other assets which negatively impacted net loss as a percentage of Gross Bookings in the year ended December 31, 2022, but did not have a similar impact in 2023.')]}\n",

Progressing towards our climate commitments requires us to invest significant effort, resources, and management time, and circumstances may arise, including those beyond our control, that may require us to revise our timelines and/or climate commitments.

For example, our San Francisco, California headquarters is projected to be vulnerable to future water scarcity and sea level rise due to climate change, as well as climate-related events including wildfires and associated power shut-offs. Climate-related events, including the increasing frequency of extreme weather events and their impact on critical infrastructure in the U.S. and elsewhere, have the potential to disrupt our business, our third-party suppliers, and the business of our customers, and may cause us to experience higher attrition, losses and additional costs to maintain or resume operations. Additionally, we are subject to emerging climate change policies such as California's Clean Miles Standard and Incentive Program and California SB 253 and SB 261, which impose greenhouse gas and EV requirements on our industry, and efforts to meet those requirements as well as failure to do so could have adverse impacts on our costs and ability to operate in California, as well as public goodwill towards our company. Massachusetts, New York City and Toronto developed and implemented rules to address the environmental impact of rideshare, and other jurisdictions are likely to consider similar rules and regulations in the future. We advocate for EV programs that can be efficiently accessed by drivers on our platform and rental car operators, and any failure of such programs to address EV capital costs, EV charging costs, and EV charging infrastructure in the context of transportation network companies' unique needs could challenge our ability to progress toward internal and external EV targets. Furthermore, these EV programs are asset-intensive and require significant capital investments and recurring costs, including debt payments, maintenance, depreciation, asset life and asset replacement costs, and if we are not able to maintain sufficient levels of utilization of such assets or such offerings are otherwise not successful, our investments may not generate sufficient returns and our financial condition may be adversely affected.

      "What are the potential risks associated with the Express Drive program and how do they impact the ridesharing marketplace?\n",
      "{'response': AIMessage(content=\"Based on the provided Lyft 10-K report (document 1), the Express Drive program faces several risks that could negatively impact the ridesharing marketplace:\\n\\n* **Dependence on Third-Party Partners:** Lyft relies heavily on third-party vehicle rental partners, as well as vehicle supply, fleet management, and finance partners.  The termination of relationships with these partners, or their inability to meet contractual obligations (as exemplified by the Hertz bankruptcy), could severely limit vehicle availability for drivers, impacting driver supply and potentially reducing the platform's attractiveness to both drivers and consumers.  Supply chain disruptions, such as vehicle recalls or impacts from public health crises, further exacerbate this risk.\\n\\n* **Higher Insurance Costs:**  Lyft's Express Drive program incurs higher insurance costs compared to other ridesharing offerings. This increased expense could affect profitability and potentially impact pricing strategies.\\n\\n* **Flexdrive Cost Management:**  If Lyft's subsidiary, Flexdrive, struggles to manage its fleet operating costs and rental fee collection, pricing adjustments might be necessary.  Price increases could make the Express Drive program less attractive to drivers, reducing participation and impacting the overall driver pool.\\n\\n* **Reputational Risk:** Negative publicity concerning Lyft's third-party partners, related to safety or quality issues, could damage Lyft's reputation and brand, leading to increased regulatory scrutiny or litigation.\\n\\n\\nThe Uber 10-K (document 2) does not directly address the risks associated with a program analogous to Lyft's Express Drive.  Therefore, a direct comparison of risks between the two companies' programs cannot be made based on the provided documents.  The Uber document focuses on the risks associated with cash payments, which is a different operational aspect of the ridesharing business.\", additional_kwargs={}, response_metadata={'prompt_feedback': {'block_reason': 0, 'safety_ratings': []}, 'finish_reason': 'STOP', 'safety_ratings': []}, id='run-aef2e3f2-fc12-4731-832e-86907fc1bc40-0', usage_metadata={'input_tokens': 1710, 'output_tokens': 361, 'total_tokens': 2071, 'input_token_details': {'cache_read': 0}}), 'context': [Document(metadata={'id': '1', 'source': 'gs://docs-10k/pdf/lyft.pdf', 'year': '2023', 'type': '10-K', 'company': 'lyft', 'url': 'https://storage.cloud.google.com/docs-10k/pdf/lyft.pdf', 'previous_segments': [], 'next_segments': [], 'relevance_score': 0.7543250918388367}, page_content=\"# We rely on third-party and affiliate vehicle rental partners for our Express Drive program, as well as third-party vehicle supply, fleet management and finance partners to support our Express Drive program, and if we cannot manage our relationships with such parties and other risks related to our Express Drive program, our business, financial condition and results of operations could be adversely affected.\\n\\nWe rely on third-party and affiliate vehicle rental partners as well as third-party vehicle supply, fleet management and finance partners to supply vehicles to drivers for our Express Drive program. If any of our third-party vehicle rental partners or third-party vehicle supply, fleet management and finance partners terminates its relationship with us or refuses to renew its agreement with us on commercially reasonable terms, the availability of vehicles for drivers in certain markets could be adversely impacted, and we may need to find an alternate provider, and may not be able to secure similar terms or replace such partners in an acceptable time frame. Similarly, in the event that vehicle manufacturers issue recalls that affect the usage or the supply of vehicles or automotive parts is interrupted, including as a result of public health crises, such as the COVID-19 pandemic, affecting vehicles in these partners' fleets, the supply of vehicles available from these partners could become constrained. In addition, in May 2020, Hertz filed for bankruptcy protection, which affected its ability to meet the requirements of our Express Drive program. If we cannot find alternate third-party vehicle rental providers on terms acceptable to us, or these partners' fleets are impacted by events such as vehicle recalls, we may not be able to meet the driver and consumer demand for rental vehicles, and as a result, our platform may be less attractive to qualified drivers and consumers. In addition, due to a number of factors, including our agreements with our vehicle rental partners and our auto-related insurance program, we incur an incrementally higher insurance cost from our Express Drive program compared to the corresponding cost from the rest of our ridesharing marketplace offerings. If Flexdrive, Lyft's independently managed subsidiary, is unable to manage costs of operating Flexdrive's fleet and potential shortfalls between such costs and the rental fees collected from drivers, Lyft and Flexdrive may update the pricing methodologies related to Flexdrive's offering in Lyft's Express Drive program which could increase prices, and in turn adversely affect our ability to attract and retain qualified drivers through the Express Drive program. 28 Any negative publicity related to any of our third-party and affiliate vehicle rental partners, including publicity related to quality standards or safety concerns, could adversely affect our reputation and brand and could potentially lead to increased regulatory or litigation exposure. Any of the foregoing risks could adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations.\"), Document(metadata={'id': '2', 'source': 'gs://docs-10k/pdf/uber.pdf', 'year': '2023', 'type': '10-K', 'company': 'Uber', 'url': 'https://storage.cloud.google.com/docs-10k/pdf/uber.pdf', 'previous_segments': [], 'next_segments': [], 'relevance_score': 0.6845096945762634}, page_content='# In certain jurisdictions, we allow consumers to pay for rides and meal or grocery deliveries using cash, which raises numerous regulatory, operational, and safety concerns. If we do not successfully manage those concerns, we could become subject to adverse regulatory actions and suffer reputational harm or other adverse financial and accounting consequences.\\n\\nIn certain jurisdictions, including India, Brazil, and Mexico, as well as certain other countries in Latin America, Europe, the Middle East, and Africa, we allow consumers to use cash to pay Drivers the entire fare of rides and cost of meal deliveries (including our service fee from such rides and meal or grocery deliveries). In 2023, cash-paid trips accounted for approximately 6% of our global Gross Bookings. This percentage may increase in the future, particularly in the markets in which Careem operates. The use of cash in connection with our technology raises numerous regulatory, operational, and safety concerns. For example, many jurisdictions have specific regulations regarding the use of cash for ridesharing and certain jurisdictions prohibit the use of cash for ridesharing. Failure to comply with these regulations could result in the imposition of significant fines and penalties and could result in a regulator requiring that we suspend operations in those jurisdictions. In addition to these regulatory concerns, the use of cash with our Mobility products and Delivery offering can increase safety and security risks for Drivers and riders, including potential robbery, assault, violent or fatal attacks, and other criminal acts. In certain jurisdictions such as Brazil, serious safety incidents resulting in robberies and violent, fatal attacks on Drivers while using our platform have been reported. If we are not able to adequately address any of these concerns, we could suffer significant reputational harm, which could adversely impact our business.')]}\n"
