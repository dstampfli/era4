My capstone project aims to provide guidance for development teams building applications using the Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) pattern. Given the wide range of available approaches, this project will conduct a side-by-side comparison of various techniques to help teams make informed decisions.

All tests will be conducted using a dataset consisting of Form 10-K documents in both HTML and PDF formats. Using RAGAS, I will generate a test set derived from this dataset and evaluate the effectiveness of each approach.

The tests I plan to conduct include:

​	1.	LangChain with OpenAI

​	2.	LangChain with Google Vertex AI Agent Builder

​	3.	Graph RAG using Neo4j

​	4.	Google Vertex AI RAG Service

​	5.	Multi-Agent System using LangGraph

Additionally, I will use LangSmith to collect performance metrics for each test.
