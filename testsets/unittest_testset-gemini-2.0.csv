(the “Company” or “Lyft”) started a movement to revolutionize transportation. In 2012, we launched our peer-to-peer marketplace for on-demand ridesharing and have continued to pioneer innovations. Today, Lyft is one of the largest multimodal transportation networks in the United States and Canada. We have an important purpose, which is to get riders out into the world so they can live their lives together, and to provide drivers a way to work that gives them control over their time and money. Our ridesharing marketplace connects drivers with riders via the Lyft mobile application (the “Lyft App”) in cities across the United States and in select cities in Canada. We have established a scaled network of users brought together by our robust technology platform (the “Lyft Platform”) that powers rides and connections every day. We leverage our technology platform, the scale and density of our user network and insights from a significant number of rides to improve our ridesharing marketplace efficiency and develop new offerings. We’ve also taken steps to ensure our network is well positioned to benefit from technological innovation in mobility. Our offerings on the Lyft App include an expanded set of transportation modes in select cities, such as access to a network of shared bikes and scooters (“Light Vehicles”) for shorter rides and first-mile and last-mile legs of multimodal trips. Substantially all of our revenue is generated from our ridesharing marketplace that connects drivers and riders. We collect service fees and commissions from drivers for their use of our ridesharing marketplace. As drivers accept more rider leads, Gross Bookings1 and Rides1 increase, driving more revenue. We also generate revenue from riders renting Light Vehicles, drivers renting vehicles through Express Drive and by making our ridesharing marketplace available to organizations through our Lyft Business offerings, such as our Concierge and Lyft Pass programs. In 2021, we began generating revenues from licensing and data access agreements. In 2022, we began generating revenues from the sale of bikes and bike station software and hardware sales substantially through our acquisition of PBSC Urban Solutions Inc (“PBSC”). Riders and drivers want and value choice, and we believe there remains an opportunity for growth in our marketplace. In September 2023, we launched Women+ Connect, a new feature that offers women and nonbinary drivers the option to turn on a preference within the Lyft App to prioritize matches with nearby women and nonbinary riders. We are focused on delivering a great rideshare experience and will continue to innovate for drivers and riders, creating an increasingly differentiated service over time. We are committed to building a durable, healthy and profitable business for riders, drivers and shareholders. Additionally, we aim to advocate through our commitment to social and environmental responsibility. Through our Lyft Up initiatives, we’re working to make sure people have access to affordable, reliable transportation to get where they need to go - no matter their income or zip code. We can’t talk about work that serves customer needs and social goals without mentioning our responsibility to our shared environment - the air we breathe and the resilience of communities we serve. We’re working to make the Lyft Platform more sustainable by helping drivers transition to electric vehicles (“EVs”), riders take more sustainable transportation modes, and businesses reduce their carbon footprint. We’ve achieved significant growth in EV rides on our platform by investing in EV driver incentives, expanding the Express Drive EV rental program, helping drivers access discounted fast charging and advocating for smart EV policy. We believe many users are loyal to Lyft because of our values, brand and commitment to social and environmental responsibility. Our values, brand and focus on customer experience are key differentiators for our business. We continue to believe that users are increasingly choosing services, including a transportation network, based on brand affinity and value alignment and we aim to make it easy for both drivers and riders to choose Lyft every time.', '<3-hop>\n\nBusiness 5 Item 1A.

We continue to believe that users are increasingly choosing services, including a transportation network, based on brand affinity and value alignment and we aim to make it easy for both drivers and riders to choose Lyft every time. Our Transportation Network Our transportation network is primarily comprised of: Ridesharing Marketplace. Our core offering connects drivers with riders. The scale of our network enables us to predict demand and proactively incentivize drivers to be available for rides in the right place at the right time. This allows us to optimize earning opportunities for drivers and offer convenient rides for riders, creating sustainable value to both sides of our marketplace. Our ridesharing marketplace connects drivers with riders in cities across the United States and in select cities in Canada. In addition to our standard rideshare offering, riders can select a variety of other rideshare offerings which include, but are not limited to, Wait & Save, Priority Pickup, XL, Extra Comfort and Black. 1 Beginning in the third quarter of 2023, we began presenting Gross Bookings and Rides as our key business metrics, which we believe best align with how management assesses our performance and measures achievement against our strategic priorities and opportunities. For the definition of Gross Bookings and Rides, refer to the “Definitions of Key Metrics” section within Item 7 of Part II of this Annual Report on Form 10-K. Express Drive. Our car rental program for drivers, including those who want to drive using our platform but do not have access to a vehicle that meets our requirements. Through our Express Drive program, drivers can enter into rental agreements with our independently managed subsidiary, Flexdrive, and our rental car partners for vehicles that may be used to provide ridesharing services on the Lyft Platform. Light Vehicles. We have a network of shared bikes and scooters in a number of cities to address the needs of users who are', ""<5-hop>\n\nlooking for options that are more active and often more cost-effective and efficient for shorter trips. These transportation modes can also help supplement the first-mile and last-mile of a multimodal trip with public transit. Drivers The drivers on our platform are active members of their communities. They are parents, students, business owners, retirees and everything in between. We work hard to serve the community of drivers on our platform, empowering them to drive on their own flexible terms while providing them the opportunity to focus their time on what matters most. Drivers on our platform also have key benefits, which include: Flexibility. We offer drivers the flexibility to generate income on their own schedule, so they can best prioritize what is important in their lives. Technology. Our predictive technology around ride volume and demand enables us to share key information with drivers about when and where to drive to maximize their earnings on a real-time basis. Transparent and Consistent Pay: We've released multiple products over the years such as upfront pay where drivers can see ride information and what they’ll earn before accepting a ride. We also launched the Weekly Pay Statement for a clearer, more comprehensive view of driver's pay details. Insurance. We procure insurance that helps protect transportation network company (“TNC”) drivers against financial losses related to automobile accidents while on the platform. Community Standards. To help us uphold high community standards, we give both drivers and riders the opportunity to rate each other after a ride booked through the Lyft App. Support. We offer drivers access to 24/7 support and earnings tools as well as education resources and other support to meet their personal goals. Riders Riders are as diverse and dynamic as the communities we serve. They represent all adult age groups and backgrounds and use Lyft to commute to and from work, explore their cities, spend more time at local businesses and stay out longer knowing they can get a reliable ride home. Unless otherwise stated, riders are passengers who request rides from drivers in our ridesharing marketplace and renters of a shared bike, scooter or automobile available on the Lyft App. We work hard to provide riders with a quality experience every time they open the Lyft App, in order to earn the right to have Lyft be their transportation network of choice. Riders on our platform also have key benefits, which include: Selection and Convenience. We designed the Lyft App with a focus on simplicity, efficiency and convenience. Our proprietary technology efficiently matches riders with drivers through advanced dispatching algorithms providing faster arrival times, localized pricing and maximum availability. Additional transportation modes, such as Light Vehicles, offer more options for shorter trips. We also continue to launch new features, such as Women+ Connect. The more rides that are taken on our platform, the better we are able to offer riders personalized experiences most suitable to their trip. Availability and Reliability. We strive to ensure that riders can get a ride when they want one. We leverage our proprietary dispatch platform and data to help drivers and riders connect efficiently and reduce wait times. As of November 2023, scheduled rides to the airport are backed by our on-time pickup promise in certain major markets. If a ride is more than ten minutes late for a scheduled pick-up, we will offer up to $100 in Lyft credits to make up for it. Affordability. Our platform empowers riders to choose from a broad set of transportation options to easily optimize for cost, comfort and time. Wait & Save, a substantial and growing portion of rides, offers riders a way to save money when they aren’t in a hurry. Safety. Since day one, we have worked continuously to enhance the safety of our platform and the ridesharing industry by developing innovative products, policies and processes. We have a dedicated safety response team, a partnership with ADT, Inc. (“ADT”) to aid in emergencies, and work with leading national organizations to inform our safety policies. We are always working to make Lyft as safe as we can. Business We work with organizations across a wide range of industries to deliver transportation solutions. Our comprehensive set of solutions allows clients to design, manage and pay for ground transportation programs that contribute to productivity and satisfaction while reducing cost and streamlining operations. Our Technology Infrastructure and Operations We organize our product teams with a full-stack development model, integrating product management, engineering, analytics, data science and design. We focus on affordability, reliability, efficiency, optimization and cohesion when developing our software. Our offerings are mobile-first and platform agnostic. We seek to continuously improve the Lyft Platform and the Lyft App. Our offerings are built on a scalable technology platform that enables us to manage peaks in demand. We have a commercial agreement with Amazon Web Services (“AWS”) for cloud services to help deliver and host our platform. As a result of our partnership, we believe we are more resilient to surges in demand on our platform or product changes we may introduce. Refer to Note 9 “Commitments and Contingencies” to the consolidated financial statements for information regarding this agreement. We designed our platform with multiple layers of redundancy to guard against data loss and deliver high availability. Both incremental and full backups are performed and redundant copies of content are stored independently in separate geographic regions. We are also investing in iterating and continuously improving our data privacy and security foundation, and continually review and implement the most relevant policies. Our Proprietary Data-Driven Technology Platform Our robust technology platform powers the millions of rides and connections that we facilitate every day and provides insights that drive our platform in real-time. We leverage historical data to continuously improve experiences for drivers and riders on our platform. Our platform analyzes large datasets covering the ride lifecycle, from when drivers go online and riders request rides, to when they match, which route to take and any feedback given after the rides. Utilizing machine learning capabilities to"", '<6-hop>\n\npredict future behavior based on many years of historical data and use cases, we employ various levers to balance supply and demand in the marketplace, creating increased driver earnings while maintaining strong service levels for riders. We also leverage our data science and algorithms to inform our product development. Our Intellectual Property We believe that our intellectual property rights are valuable and important to our business. We rely on trademarks, patents, copyrights, trade secrets, license agreements, intellectual property assignment agreements, confidentiality procedures, non-disclosure agreements and employee non-disclosure and invention assignment agreements to establish and protect our proprietary rights. Though we rely in part upon these legal and contractual protections, we believe that factors such as the skills and ingenuity of our employees and the functionality and frequent enhancements to our solutions and offerings are larger contributors to our success in the marketplace. We have invested in a patent program to identify and protect a substantial portion of our strategic intellectual property in ridesharing, autonomous vehicle-related technology, micro-mobility, telecommunications, networking and other technologies relevant to our business. We hold numerous issued and pending patents in the U.S. and foreign jurisdictions and continually review our development efforts to assess the existence and patentability of new intellectual property. We have an ongoing trademark and service mark registration program pursuant to which we seek to register our brand names and product names, taglines and logos in the United States and other countries to the extent we determine appropriate and cost-effective. We also have common law rights in some trademarks. In addition, we have registered domain names for websites that we use in our business, such as www.lyft.com and other variations. We intend to pursue additional intellectual property protection to the extent we believe it would be beneficial and cost-effective. Despite our efforts to protect our intellectual property rights, they may not be respected in the future or may be invalidated, circumvented or challenged. For additional information, see the sections titled “Risk Factors—Risks Related to Regulatory and Legal Factors—Claims by others that we infringed their proprietary technology or other intellectual property rights could harm our business” and “Risk Factors—Risks Related to Regulatory and Legal Factors—Failure to protect or enforce our intellectual property rights could harm our business, financial condition and results of operations.” Our Growth Strategy Transportation represents a massive market opportunity, one that we are in the very early stages of addressing. Our key growth strategies include our plans to: Increase Rider Use Cases. We are continuously working to make Lyft the transportation network of choice across an expanding range of use cases. We offer products to simplify travel decision-making, for example with our Lyft Pink subscription plan, Lyft Pass commuter programs, first-mile and last-mile services and university ride smart programs. We also provide centralized tools and enterprise transportation solutions, such as our Concierge offering, that enable organizations to manage the transportation needs of customers, employees and other constituents. Grow Active Riders. We see opportunities to continue to grow our rider base. We may make incremental investments in our brand and in growth marketing to maintain and drive increasing consumer preference for Lyft. We strive to provide a full range of price points and ride experiences such as Wait & Save, which allows riders to save money by waiting for a ride, and Priority Pickup, which provides a premium experience by allowing riders to pay for prioritized pickup. We plan to continue to grow our ridesharing marketplace by prioritizing competitive service levels and attracting and retaining more drivers and riders on our network. Additionally, we continue to evaluate ways to expand our network coverage beyond the geographies and markets we currently serve. We also believe we are a beneficiary of demographic shifts, such as the growing percentage of the U.S. population that is accustomed to on-demand services and has digital-first preferences. Grow Our Share of Consumers’ Transportation Spend. Lyft’s transportation network is designed to address a wide range of mobility needs. The Lyft network spans rideshare, bikes, and scooters and we are well positioned to deliver the best holistic experience to all of our riders and to capture significantly more of our market opportunity. Deliver Increasing Value to Drivers. We strive to provide drivers that use Lyft with the best possible experience, including access to a variety of economic opportunities. For example, through our Express Drive program, drivers can get access to rental cars they can use for ridesharing. We also provide drivers with a suite of resources, including access to our on-demand, 24/7 support through our Driver app, to ensure drivers have the resources they need before taking the road. Invest in our Marketplace Technology. Our investments in our proprietary technology allow us to deliver a convenient and high-quality experience to drivers and riders and additional investments in our payments and data science capabilities have been central to making our network more efficient and seamless to use. Competition The market for Transportation-as-a-Service (“TaaS”) networks is intensely competitive and characterized by rapid changes in technology, shifting levels of demand and frequent introductions of new services and offerings. We expect competition to continue, both from current competitors and new entrants in the market that may be well-established and enjoy greater resources or other strategic advantages. If we are unable to anticipate or successfully react to these competitive challenges in a timely manner, our competitive position could weaken, or fail to improve, and we could experience a decline in revenue or growth stagnation that could adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations. Our main ridesharing competitor in the United States and Canada is Uber, though we also compete with other ridesharing transportation network companies, and taxi cab and livery companies as well as traditional automotive manufacturers. Our main competitors in the bike and scooter sharing market include Lime, Bird, Fifteen and Tier. We also compete with other manufacturers of bike and scooter sharing equipment for sales of such equipment, particularly in markets outside of the United States. Additionally, there are other non-U.S.-based TaaS', '<7-hop>\n\nUnited States and other jurisdictions. Laws, regulations and standards governing issues such as TNCs, public companies, ridesharing, worker classification, labor and employment, anti-discrimination, payments, gift cards, whistleblowing and worker confidentiality obligations, product liability, defects, recalls, auto maintenance and repairs, personal injury, advertising, text messaging, subscription services, intellectual property, securities, consumer protection, taxation, privacy, data security, competition, unionizing and collective action, antitrust, arbitration agreements and class action waiver provisions, terms of service, mobile application accessibility, autonomous vehicles, bike and scooter sharing, insurance, vehicle rentals, money transmittal, non-emergency medical transportation, healthcare fraud, waste, and abuse, environmental health and safety, greenhouse gas emissions, background checks, public health, anti-corruption, anti-bribery, political contributions, lobbying, import and export restrictions, trade and economic sanctions, foreign ownership and investment, foreign exchange controls and delivery of goods including (but not limited to) medical supplies, perishable foods and prescription drugs are often complex and subject to varying interpretations, in many cases due to their lack of specificity. As a result, their application in practice may change or develop over time through judicial decisions or as new guidance or interpretations are provided by regulatory and governing bodies, such as federal, state and local administrative agencies. The TNC industry has also come under increasing scrutiny from non-profit organizations, regulators, and legislators for its environmental impact, specifically increasing greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions. In 2018, California passed first-of-its-kind legislation (the “California Clean Miles Standard”) to mandate that TNCs increase the percentage of zero-emission vehicles on their platforms, with additional requirements to reduce their GHG emissions on a GHG per passenger-mile basis. Policymakers have since passed similar legislation in Massachusetts and New York City to grow EV TNC rides, and may do so in other jurisdictions. See the sections titled “Business” and “Risk Factors” including the subsections titled “Business – Environmental, Social and Corporate Governance - Environmental” and “Risk Factors—Risks Related to Regulatory and Legal Factors” for additional information about the laws and regulations we are subject to and the risks to our business associated with such laws and regulations. Human Capital Our employees are our human capital and, together with our technology stack, they are our greatest strength and most valuable resource. The workplace environment has changed significantly in the last couple of years and we have changed our philosophy to reflect what we believe will produce the best results for our employees and business moving forward. Thus, in 2023, we welcomed employees back to the office and have implemented a hybrid model where employees have the flexibility to work from home. As of December 31, 2023, we had 2,945 employees and we maintain additional offices in multiple locations in the U.S. and internationally in Montreal, Canada, Mexico City, Mexico, Kyiv, Ukraine, Berlin, Germany, Munich, Germany and Minsk, Belarus. None of our employees are represented by a labor union or covered by a collective bargaining agreement. We have not experienced any work stoppages and we consider our relations with our employees to be positive. We believe that achieving more diversity in workforce representation is an important priority. We are a company with a diverse customer base, and the more our employees reflect that diversity, the better we can serve our customers, ultimately making our business stronger. As of December 31, 2023, our employee base was 57% male and 40% female, and women represented 42% of our leadership overall. The ethnicity of our U.S. employees was 46% White, 32% Asian, 9% Hispanic or Latinx, 7% Black, and 5% two or more races, American Indian, Alaska Native, Native Hawaiian or other Pacific Islander. Our employee gender and ethnicity information is based on self-identification, and employees who did not disclose their gender or ethnicity have been excluded from the applicable disclosure. As of December 31, 2023, employees who did not disclose gender represented approximately 3% of total employees, and employees who did not disclose ethnicity represented approximately 1% of total U.S. employees. We strive to build a more representative workforce which requires an intentional and comprehensive effort to reach and recruit outstanding candidates, develop talent internally, and open up pathways for advancement. We are continuing to focus on scaling and sustaining diverse partnerships and early candidate pipeline development as we believe recruiting and hiring initiatives can yield short and long-term benefits to the organization. In 2023, we continued our partnerships and outreach programs by holding partnership events with organizations that aim to increase diversity in enterprise hiring pools, such as BreakLine, Tribaja, and Disability:IN. We also maintained representation in our hiring pool through our sourcing tool, hireEZ, and held disability and inclusion training for team members with the Inclusively and Direct Employers organizations. Environmental, Social and Corporate Governance (“ESG”) We are proud of the impact we made on people and the planet in 2023, and we have reported in depth on what we have done in our 2023 ESG Report. As we grow, we’ll touch millions more lives — economically, socially, and environmentally. Environmental We have a responsibility to our shared environment — the air we breathe and the resilience of communities we serve. Our environmental impact also gives drivers and riders another great reason to choose Lyft, and is an intrinsic part of how we think about 10 our business goals. We are working to make the Lyft Platform more sustainable by helping drivers transition to EVs, riders take more sustainable modes, and businesses reduce their carbon footprint. The rides that we facilitate on our platform make up over 95% of Lyft’s carbon emissions. Transitioning these rides from gas-powered to electric vehicles is the one of the best ways we can contribute long-term toward a cleaner planet. Over 8 million riders rode in an EV in 2023. Rides in electric vehicles generally get higher ratings and tips compared to rides in hybrids and gas cars. Over 20% of rides on the Lyft Platform are currently in a hybrid or an EV. In April 2023, we launched Green, where riders can select an EV or hybrid vehicle, specifically for business travelers, and in January 2024, we expanded', '<8-hop>\n\nGreen to nearly 40 airports in North America. Because we stand at a pivotal moment in the fight against climate change, Lyft strives to grow EVs on the platform. In 2020, we made a commitment to reach 100% EVs across the Lyft Platform by the end of 2030. We still believe in the long-term transition to EVs, but now do not see a path to completing our transition to 100% EVs by 2030 given the current EV landscape. Over the course of 2024 and 2025, we will invest an additional $80 million total to support EV drivers and encourage gas-powered drivers to make the switch. We expect this investment to help us reach 100 million all-time EV rides on the platform by the end of 2025. Most of this funding will go to drivers in states that are committed to electrifying, developing infrastructure, and growing EV adoption as quickly as possible. Social Lyft’s purpose is to get people out into the world so they can live their lives together, and provide drivers a meaningful way to earn that gives them control over their time and money. We’re constantly thinking about the role we play in our customers’ lives. For riders, social interaction improves physical and mental health. We’re making it easier to get out of the house, and the hundreds of millions of rides we facilitated in 2023 connected people with friends, family, and coworkers. Everyday encounters like these help people feel happier and more connected to their community. For drivers, Lyft is part of the economic fabric of millions of lives. Drivers may be students putting themselves through college, parents looking for a way to earn while their kids are in school, or seniors interested in meeting new people. The flexibility to work on their own schedules is a core benefit of driving with Lyft, and millions of drivers use the platform to support their families or build toward their dreams. We keep working to understand who drivers are and how they use Lyft through our annual Economic Impact Report. We want to improve the lives of everyone we interact with, but know that targeted programs can have an outsized impact. Through our Lyft Up initiative, we’re working to provide riders access to affordable, reliable transportation to get where they need to go — no matter their age, income, zip, or postal code. In 2023, Lyft provided access to millions of discounted or donated rideshare, bikeshare, and shared scooter rides to people in need. We provided access to millions of discounted or donated rideshare, bikeshare, and shared scooter rides to help people in need. Some of our current Lyft Up programs assist the community by providing rides to and from jobs, job interviews and trainings, the grocery store for those living in food-insecure areas, and by providing discounted bikeshare memberships and heavily discounted electric bikes to income eligible riders. Other Lyft Up programs provide donated ride credits to resettlement agencies and other community based organizations helping refugees access essential needs and services or relief rides in the aftermath of natural or manmade disasters. Corporate Governance Our board of directors regularly evaluates our environmental, social, and corporate governance policies to make sure they fit into our strategy of driving long-term stockholder value and align with our core values. More information about our directors, executive officers and corporate governance will be included in our definitive Proxy Statement for our 2024 Annual Meeting of Stockholders. Corporate Information We were incorporated in 2007 as Bounder Web, Inc., a Delaware corporation. In 2008, we changed our name to Zimride, Inc. We founded Lyft in 2012 and changed our name to Lyft, Inc. in 2013 when we sold the assets related to our Zimride operations. 11 Available Information Our website is located at www.lyft.com, and our investor relations website is located at investor.lyft.com.

The SEC also maintains a website that contains our SEC filings at www.sec.gov. We announce material information to the public about us, our products and services and other matters through a variety of means, including filings with the SEC, press releases, public conference calls, webcasts, the investor relations section of our website (investor.lyft.com), our X accounts (@lyft and @davidrisher) and our blogs (including: lyft.com/blog, lyft.com/hub and eng.lyft.com) in order to achieve broad, non-exclusionary distribution of information to the public and for complying with our disclosure obligations under Regulation FD.

Risk Factors. Investing in our Class A common stock involves a high degree of risk. You should carefully consider the risks and uncertainties described below, together with all of the other information in this Annual Report on Form 10-K, including the section titled “Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations” and our consolidated financial statements and related notes, before making a decision to invest in our Class A common stock. Our business, financial condition, results of operations or prospects could also be harmed by risks and uncertainties not currently known to us or that we currently do not believe are material. If any of the risks actually occur, our business, financial condition, results of operations and prospects could be adversely affected. In that event, the market price of our Class A common stock could decline, and you could', '<9-hop>\n\nbelieve that our ability to compete effectively depends upon many factors both within and beyond our control, and if we are unable to compete successfully, our business, financial condition and results of operations could be adversely affected. Our results of operations vary and are unpredictable from period-to-period, which could cause the trading price of our Class A common stock to decline. Our results of operations have historically varied from period-to-period and we expect that our results of operations will continue to do so for a variety of reasons, many of which are outside of our control and difficult to predict. Because our results of operations may vary significantly from quarter-to-quarter and year-to-year, the results of any one period should not be relied upon as an indication of future performance. We have presented many of the factors that may cause our results of operations to fluctuate in this “Risk Factors” section. Fluctuations in our results of operations may cause such results to fall below our financial guidance or other projections, or the expectations of analysts or investors, which could cause the trading price of our Class A common stock to decline. The ridesharing market and the market for our other offerings, such as our network of Light Vehicles, are still in relatively early stages of growth and development and if such markets do not continue to grow, grow more slowly than we expect or fail to grow as large or otherwise develop as we expect, our business, financial condition and results of operations could be adversely affected. Prior to COVID-19, the ridesharing market grew rapidly, but it is still relatively new, and it is uncertain to what extent market acceptance will continue to grow, if at all. In addition, the market for our other offerings, such as our network of Light Vehicles, is relatively new and unproven, and it is uncertain whether demand for bike and scooter sharing will continue to grow and achieve wide market acceptance. In July 2023, we announced that we are exploring strategic alternatives for our Light Vehicles business. Our success will depend to a substantial extent on the willingness of people to widely adopt ridesharing and our other offerings across a variety of use cases. We cannot be certain whether the behavioral and social impacts of the COVID-19 pandemic will continue to negatively impact the willingness of drivers or riders to participate in ridesharing or rider demand for shared bikes or scooters, or otherwise limit market growth. In addition, in response to the COVID-19 pandemic, we paused our Shared Rides offerings, and we were temporarily restricted from operating our scooter share program in one jurisdiction due to public health and safety measures. We had to suspend or discontinue these offerings from time to time due to various concerns. In the event of significant public health concerns, such as COVID-19, or other events beyond our control, we may be required or believe it is advisable to suspend such offerings again. If the public does not perceive ridesharing or our other offerings as beneficial, or chooses not to adopt them as a result of concerns regarding public health or safety, affordability or for other reasons, whether as a result of incidents on our platform or on our competitors’ platforms, health concerns, or otherwise, then the market for our offerings may not further develop, may develop more slowly than we expect or may not achieve the growth potential we expect. Additionally, from time to time we re-evaluate the 18 markets in which we operate and the performance of our offerings, and we have discontinued and may in the future discontinue operations in certain markets as a result of such evaluations. For example, we now offer Shared Rides exclusively in connection with business-to-business partnerships and only in select markets. Any of the foregoing risks and challenges could adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations. If we fail to cost-effectively attract and retain qualified drivers on our platform, or to increase the utilization of our platform by existing drivers, our business, financial condition and results of operations could be harmed. Our continued growth depends in part on our ability to cost-effectively attract and retain qualified drivers who satisfy our screening criteria and procedures and to increase their utilization of our platform. To attract and retain qualified drivers, we have, among other things, offered sign-up and referral bonuses and provided access to third-party vehicle rental programs for drivers who do not have or do not wish to use their own vehicle. Drivers are generally able to switch between our platform and competing platforms. If we do not continue to provide drivers with flexibility on our platform, compelling opportunities to increase earnings and other incentive programs, such as demand-based bonuses, that are comparable or superior to those of our competitors and other companies in the app-based work industry or other industries, or if drivers become dissatisfied with our programs and benefits or our requirements for drivers, including requirements regarding the vehicles they drive, we may fail to attract new drivers, retain current drivers or increase their utilization of our platform, or we may experience complaints, negative publicity, strikes or other work stoppages that could adversely affect our users and our business. For example, during the COVID-19 pandemic, we experienced a shortage of available drivers relative to rider demand in certain markets and offered increased incentives to improve driver supply. Our revenue and results of operations have in prior periods been negatively impacted by supply incentives, and to the extent that driver availability remains limited and we offer increased incentives to improve supply, our revenue and results of operations may be negatively impacted in the future. Additionally, following the passage of Proposition 22 in California, drivers have been able to access the earning opportunities described in the ballot measure. In addition, in connection with a settlement with the New York Attorney General, the Company will implement certain operational changes that may entail increased costs. Further, other jurisdictions may adopt similar laws', ""<10-hop>\n\nwho drivers are and how they use Lyft through our annual Economic Impact Report.

Risk Factors” section, riders are passengers who request rides from drivers in our ridesharing marketplace and renters of a shared bike, scooter or automobile. Risk Factor Summary Our business operations are subject to numerous risks, factors and uncertainties, including those outside of our control, that could cause our actual results to be harmed, including risks regarding the following: General economic factors general macroeconomic conditions; the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic and responsive measures; natural disasters, economic downturns, public health crises or political crises; Operational factors our limited operating history; our financial performance and any inability to achieve or maintain profitability in the future; competition in our industries; the unpredictability of our results of operations and uncertainty regarding the growth of the ridesharing and other markets; our ability to attract and retain qualified drivers and riders; our insurance coverage, the adequacy of our insurance reserves, and the ability of third-party insurance providers to service our auto-related insurance claims; our reputation and brand; illegal or improper activity of users of our platform; the accuracy of background checks on potential or current drivers and our third party providers' ability to effectively conduct such background checks; changes to our pricing practices; the growth and development of our network of Light Vehicles and the quality of and supply chain for our Light Vehicles; our autonomous vehicle technology, partnerships with other companies who offer autonomous vehicle technologies, and the overall development of the autonomous vehicle industry; claims from riders, drivers or third parties; our ability to manage our growth; actual or perceived security or privacy breaches or incidents and resulting interruptions in our availability or the availability of other systems and providers; our reliance on third parties, such as Amazon Web Services, vehicle rental partners, payment processors and other service providers; our ability to operate our Express Drive program; our nascent advertising business, Lyft Media; our use of artificial"", '<11-hop>\n\nCompetitive Environment We compete on a global basis in highly fragmented markets. We face significant competition in each of the mobility and delivery industries globally and in the logistics industry in the United States and Canada from existing, well-established, and low-cost alternatives, and in the future we expect to face competition from new market entrants given the low barriers to entry that characterize these industries. As we and our competitors introduce new products and offerings, and as existing products evolve, we expect to become subject to additional competition. While we work to expand globally and introduce new products and offerings across a range of industries, many of our competitors remain focused on a limited number of products or on a narrow geographic scope, allowing them to develop specialized expertise and employ resources in a more targeted manner than we do. The competition we face in each of our offerings includes: Mobility. Our Mobility offering competes with personal vehicle ownership and usage, which accounts for the majority of passenger miles in the markets that we serve, and traditional transportation services, including taxicab companies and taxi-hailing services, livery and other car services. In addition, public transportation can be a superior substitute to our Mobility offering and in many cases, offers a faster and lower-cost travel option in many cities. We also compete with other ridesharing companies, including certain of our minority-owned entities, for Drivers and Riders, including Lyft, Ola, Didi, and Bolt. Delivery. Our Delivery offering competes with numerous companies in the meal, grocery and other delivery space in various regions for drivers, consumers, and merchants, including Amazon, Deliveroo, Delivery Hero, DoorDash, iFood, Instacart, Just Eat Takeaway, and Rappi. Our Delivery offering also competes with restaurants, including those that offer their own delivery and/or take-away, meal kit delivery services, grocery delivery services, and traditional grocers. Freight. Our Freight offering competes with global and North American freight brokers and managed transportation providers such as C.H. Robinson, Total Quality Logistics, XPO Logistics, Echo Global Logistics, Coyote, Transfix, DHL, and NEXT Trucking.', ""<12-hop>\n\nand Merchants with end-users to facilitate the completion of a successful ridesharing trip or delivery. In certain markets, we also generate revenue from end-users and charge a direct fee for use of the platform or in exchange for Mobility or Delivery services. Judgment is required in evaluating the presentation of revenue on a gross versus net basis based on whether we control the service provided to the end-user and are the principal in the transaction (gross), or we arrange for other parties to provide the service to the end-user and are the agent in the transaction (net). The assessment of whether we are considered the principal or the agent in a transaction could impact the accounting for certain payments and incentives provided to Drivers and end-users and change the timing and amount of revenue recognized. Driver Incentives We offer various incentive programs to Drivers. Judgment is required to determine the appropriate classification of these incentives. Incentives provided to customers are recorded as a reduction of revenue if we do not receive a distinct service in exchange or cannot reasonably estimate the fair value of the service received. Incentives offered in exchange for specific services, such as referral services are recorded as sales and marketing expenses. End-User Discounts and Promotions We offer discounts and promotions to end-users (that are not customers) to encourage use of our platform. Judgment is required to determine the appropriate classification of these incentives. End-user discounts and promotions are recorded to sales and marketing expenses with the exception of market-wide promotions which are recorded as a reduction of revenue. Business Combinations We allocate the fair value of purchase consideration to the tangible assets acquired, liabilities assumed, and intangible assets acquired based on their estimated fair values. The excess of the fair value of purchase consideration over the fair values of these identifiable assets and liabilities is recorded as goodwill. Such valuations require management to make significant estimates and assumptions, especially with respect to intangible assets. Significant estimates in valuing certain intangible assets include, but are not limited to, future expected cash flows from acquired advertiser, fleet, merchant, and end-user contracts, acquired technology, and trade names, based on expected future growth rates and margins, attrition rates, future changes in technology and royalty for similar brand licenses, useful lives, and discount rates. Management's estimates of fair value are based upon assumptions believed to be reasonable, but which are inherently uncertain and unpredictable and, as a result, actual results may differ from estimates. Allocation of purchase consideration to identifiable assets and liabilities affects our amortization expense, as acquired finite-lived intangible assets are amortized over the useful life, whereas any indefinite lived intangible assets, including goodwill, are not amortized. During the measurement period, which may be up to one year from the acquisition date, we may record adjustments to the assets acquired and liabilities assumed, with the corresponding offset to goodwill. Upon the conclusion of the measurement period, any subsequent adjustments are recorded to earnings. Investments—Non-Marketable Equity and Debt Securities We hold investments in privately held companies in the form of equity securities and debt securities without readily determinable fair values and in which we do not have a controlling interest or significant influence. Investments in equity securities without readily determinable fair values are initially recorded at cost and are subsequently adjusted to fair value for impairments and price changes from observable transactions in the same or a similar security from the same issuer. Investments in material available-for-sale debt securities are recorded initially at fair value and subsequently remeasured to fair value at each reporting date with the changes in fair value recognized in other comprehensive income (loss), net of tax. We may elect the fair value option for financial instruments and account for investments in debt and equity securities at fair value with changes reported in net income (loss) from continuing operations. Investments in privately held equity and debt securities are valued using significant unobservable inputs or data in inactive markets. This valuation requires judgment due to the absence of market prices and inherent lack of liquidity and are classified as Level 3 in the fair value hierarchy. In determining the estimated fair value of our investments in privately held companies, we utilize the most recent data available including observed transactions such as equity financing transactions of the investees and sales of the existing shares of the investees’ securities. In addition, the determination of whether an observed transaction is similar to the equity and debt securities held by us requires significant management judgment based on the rights and preferences of the securities. We assess our investment portfolio of privately held equity and debt securities quarterly for impairment. The impairment analysis for investments in equity securities includes a qualitative analysis of factors including the investee’s financial performance, industry and market conditions, and other relevant factors. If an equity investment is considered to be impaired we will establish a new carrying value for the investment and recognize an impairment loss through our consolidated statement of operations. Investments in debt 65 securities are evaluated for impairment quarterly based on whether its fair value has declined below its amortized cost. In circumstances where we intend to sell, or are more likely than not required to sell the security before it recovers its amortized cost basis, the difference between the fair value and amortized cost is recognized as a loss in the consolidated financial statement of operations, with a corresponding write-down of the security’s amortized cost. In circumstances where neither condition exists, we then evaluate whether a decline is due to credit-related factors. The factors considered in determining whether a credit loss exists can include the extent to which fair value is less than the amortized cost basis, changes in the credit quality of the underlying loan obligor’s, credit ratings actions, as well as other factors. To determine the portion of a decline in fair value that is credit-related, we compare the present value of the expected cash flows of the security discounted at the""]","Drivers on the Lyft platform benefit from flexibility in generating income on their own schedule, technology that provides key information about ride volume and demand to maximize earnings, transparent and consistent pay, insurance, community standards, and 24/7 support.

(the “Company” or “Lyft”) started a movement to revolutionize transportation. In 2012, we launched our peer-to-peer marketplace for on-demand ridesharing and have continued to pioneer innovations. Today, Lyft is one of the largest multimodal transportation networks in the United States and Canada. We have an important purpose, which is to get riders out into the world so they can live their lives together, and to provide drivers a way to work that gives them control over their time and money. Our ridesharing marketplace connects drivers with riders via the Lyft mobile application (the “Lyft App”) in cities across the United States and in select cities in Canada. We have established a scaled network of users brought together by our robust technology platform (the “Lyft Platform”) that powers rides and connections every day. We leverage our technology platform, the scale and density of our user network and insights from a significant number of rides to improve our ridesharing marketplace efficiency and develop new offerings. We’ve also taken steps to ensure our network is well positioned to benefit from technological innovation in mobility. Our offerings on the Lyft App include an expanded set of transportation modes in select cities, such as access to a network of shared bikes and scooters (“Light Vehicles”) for shorter rides and first-mile and last-mile legs of multimodal trips. Substantially all of our revenue is generated from our ridesharing marketplace that connects drivers and riders. We collect service fees and commissions from drivers for their use of our ridesharing marketplace. As drivers accept more rider leads, Gross Bookings1 and Rides1 increase, driving more revenue. We also generate revenue from riders renting Light Vehicles, drivers renting vehicles through Express Drive and by making our ridesharing marketplace available to organizations through our Lyft Business offerings, such as our Concierge and Lyft Pass programs. In 2021, we began generating revenues from licensing and data access agreements. In 2022, we began generating revenues from the sale of bikes and bike station software and hardware sales substantially through our acquisition of PBSC Urban Solutions Inc (“PBSC”). Riders and drivers want and value choice, and we believe there remains an opportunity for growth in our marketplace. In September 2023, we launched Women+ Connect, a new feature that offers women and nonbinary drivers the option to turn on a preference within the Lyft App to prioritize matches with nearby women and nonbinary riders. We are focused on delivering a great rideshare experience and will continue to innovate for drivers and riders, creating an increasingly differentiated service over time. We are committed to building a durable, healthy and profitable business for riders, drivers and shareholders. Additionally, we aim to advocate through our commitment to social and environmental responsibility. Through our Lyft Up initiatives, we’re working to make sure people have access to affordable, reliable transportation to get where they need to go - no matter their income or zip code. We can’t talk about work that serves customer needs and social goals without mentioning our responsibility to our shared environment - the air we breathe and the resilience of communities we serve. We’re working to make the Lyft Platform more sustainable by helping drivers transition to electric vehicles (“EVs”), riders take more sustainable transportation modes, and businesses reduce their carbon footprint. We’ve achieved significant growth in EV rides on our platform by investing in EV driver incentives, expanding the Express Drive EV rental program, helping drivers access discounted fast charging and advocating for smart EV policy. We believe many users are loyal to Lyft because of our values, brand and commitment to social and environmental responsibility. Our values, brand and focus on customer experience are key differentiators for our business. We continue to believe that users are increasingly choosing services, including a transportation network, based on brand affinity and value alignment and we aim to make it easy for both drivers and riders to choose Lyft every time.', '<3-hop>\n\nBusiness 5 Item 1A.

We continue to believe that users are increasingly choosing services, including a transportation network, based on brand affinity and value alignment and we aim to make it easy for both drivers and riders to choose Lyft every time. Our Transportation Network Our transportation network is primarily comprised of: Ridesharing Marketplace. Our core offering connects drivers with riders. The scale of our network enables us to predict demand and proactively incentivize drivers to be available for rides in the right place at the right time. This allows us to optimize earning opportunities for drivers and offer convenient rides for riders, creating sustainable value to both sides of our marketplace. Our ridesharing marketplace connects drivers with riders in cities across the United States and in select cities in Canada. In addition to our standard rideshare offering, riders can select a variety of other rideshare offerings which include, but are not limited to, Wait & Save, Priority Pickup, XL, Extra Comfort and Black. 1 Beginning in the third quarter of 2023, we began presenting Gross Bookings and Rides as our key business metrics, which we believe best align with how management assesses our performance and measures achievement against our strategic priorities and opportunities. For the definition of Gross Bookings and Rides, refer to the “Definitions of Key Metrics” section within Item 7 of Part II of this Annual Report on Form 10-K. Express Drive. Our car rental program for drivers, including those who want to drive using our platform but do not have access to a vehicle that meets our requirements. Through our Express Drive program, drivers can enter into rental agreements with our independently managed subsidiary, Flexdrive, and our rental car partners for vehicles that may be used to provide ridesharing services on the Lyft Platform. Light Vehicles. We have a network of shared bikes and scooters in a number of cities to address the needs of users who are', ""<5-hop>\n\nlooking for options that are more active and often more cost-effective and efficient for shorter trips. These transportation modes can also help supplement the first-mile and last-mile of a multimodal trip with public transit. Drivers The drivers on our platform are active members of their communities. They are parents, students, business owners, retirees and everything in between. We work hard to serve the community of drivers on our platform, empowering them to drive on their own flexible terms while providing them the opportunity to focus their time on what matters most. Drivers on our platform also have key benefits, which include: Flexibility. We offer drivers the flexibility to generate income on their own schedule, so they can best prioritize what is important in their lives. Technology. Our predictive technology around ride volume and demand enables us to share key information with drivers about when and where to drive to maximize their earnings on a real-time basis. Transparent and Consistent Pay: We've released multiple products over the years such as upfront pay where drivers can see ride information and what they’ll earn before accepting a ride. We also launched the Weekly Pay Statement for a clearer, more comprehensive view of driver's pay details. Insurance. We procure insurance that helps protect transportation network company (“TNC”) drivers against financial losses related to automobile accidents while on the platform. Community Standards. To help us uphold high community standards, we give both drivers and riders the opportunity to rate each other after a ride booked through the Lyft App. Support. We offer drivers access to 24/7 support and earnings tools as well as education resources and other support to meet their personal goals. Riders Riders are as diverse and dynamic as the communities we serve. They represent all adult age groups and backgrounds and use Lyft to commute to and from work, explore their cities, spend more time at local businesses and stay out longer knowing they can get a reliable ride home. Unless otherwise stated, riders are passengers who request rides from drivers in our ridesharing marketplace and renters of a shared bike, scooter or automobile available on the Lyft App. We work hard to provide riders with a quality experience every time they open the Lyft App, in order to earn the right to have Lyft be their transportation network of choice. Riders on our platform also have key benefits, which include: Selection and Convenience. We designed the Lyft App with a focus on simplicity, efficiency and convenience. Our proprietary technology efficiently matches riders with drivers through advanced dispatching algorithms providing faster arrival times, localized pricing and maximum availability. Additional transportation modes, such as Light Vehicles, offer more options for shorter trips. We also continue to launch new features, such as Women+ Connect. The more rides that are taken on our platform, the better we are able to offer riders personalized experiences most suitable to their trip. Availability and Reliability. We strive to ensure that riders can get a ride when they want one. We leverage our proprietary dispatch platform and data to help drivers and riders connect efficiently and reduce wait times. As of November 2023, scheduled rides to the airport are backed by our on-time pickup promise in certain major markets. If a ride is more than ten minutes late for a scheduled pick-up, we will offer up to $100 in Lyft credits to make up for it. Affordability. Our platform empowers riders to choose from a broad set of transportation options to easily optimize for cost, comfort and time. Wait & Save, a substantial and growing portion of rides, offers riders a way to save money when they aren’t in a hurry. Safety. Since day one, we have worked continuously to enhance the safety of our platform and the ridesharing industry by developing innovative products, policies and processes. We have a dedicated safety response team, a partnership with ADT, Inc. (“ADT”) to aid in emergencies, and work with leading national organizations to inform our safety policies. We are always working to make Lyft as safe as we can. Business We work with organizations across a wide range of industries to deliver transportation solutions. Our comprehensive set of solutions allows clients to design, manage and pay for ground transportation programs that contribute to productivity and satisfaction while reducing cost and streamlining operations. Our Technology Infrastructure and Operations We organize our product teams with a full-stack development model, integrating product management, engineering, analytics, data science and design. We focus on affordability, reliability, efficiency, optimization and cohesion when developing our software. Our offerings are mobile-first and platform agnostic. We seek to continuously improve the Lyft Platform and the Lyft App. Our offerings are built on a scalable technology platform that enables us to manage peaks in demand. We have a commercial agreement with Amazon Web Services (“AWS”) for cloud services to help deliver and host our platform. As a result of our partnership, we believe we are more resilient to surges in demand on our platform or product changes we may introduce. Refer to Note 9 “Commitments and Contingencies” to the consolidated financial statements for information regarding this agreement. We designed our platform with multiple layers of redundancy to guard against data loss and deliver high availability. Both incremental and full backups are performed and redundant copies of content are stored independently in separate geographic regions. We are also investing in iterating and continuously improving our data privacy and security foundation, and continually review and implement the most relevant policies. Our Proprietary Data-Driven Technology Platform Our robust technology platform powers the millions of rides and connections that we facilitate every day and provides insights that drive our platform in real-time. We leverage historical data to continuously improve experiences for drivers and riders on our platform. Our platform analyzes large datasets covering the ride lifecycle, from when drivers go online and riders request rides, to when they match, which route to take and any feedback given after the rides. Utilizing machine learning capabilities to"", '<6-hop>\n\npredict future behavior based on many years of historical data and use cases, we employ various levers to balance supply and demand in the marketplace, creating increased driver earnings while maintaining strong service levels for riders. We also leverage our data science and algorithms to inform our product development. Our Intellectual Property We believe that our intellectual property rights are valuable and important to our business. We rely on trademarks, patents, copyrights, trade secrets, license agreements, intellectual property assignment agreements, confidentiality procedures, non-disclosure agreements and employee non-disclosure and invention assignment agreements to establish and protect our proprietary rights. Though we rely in part upon these legal and contractual protections, we believe that factors such as the skills and ingenuity of our employees and the functionality and frequent enhancements to our solutions and offerings are larger contributors to our success in the marketplace. We have invested in a patent program to identify and protect a substantial portion of our strategic intellectual property in ridesharing, autonomous vehicle-related technology, micro-mobility, telecommunications, networking and other technologies relevant to our business. We hold numerous issued and pending patents in the U.S. and foreign jurisdictions and continually review our development efforts to assess the existence and patentability of new intellectual property. We have an ongoing trademark and service mark registration program pursuant to which we seek to register our brand names and product names, taglines and logos in the United States and other countries to the extent we determine appropriate and cost-effective. We also have common law rights in some trademarks. In addition, we have registered domain names for websites that we use in our business, such as www.lyft.com and other variations. We intend to pursue additional intellectual property protection to the extent we believe it would be beneficial and cost-effective. Despite our efforts to protect our intellectual property rights, they may not be respected in the future or may be invalidated, circumvented or challenged. For additional information, see the sections titled “Risk Factors—Risks Related to Regulatory and Legal Factors—Claims by others that we infringed their proprietary technology or other intellectual property rights could harm our business” and “Risk Factors—Risks Related to Regulatory and Legal Factors—Failure to protect or enforce our intellectual property rights could harm our business, financial condition and results of operations.” Our Growth Strategy Transportation represents a massive market opportunity, one that we are in the very early stages of addressing. Our key growth strategies include our plans to: Increase Rider Use Cases. We are continuously working to make Lyft the transportation network of choice across an expanding range of use cases. We offer products to simplify travel decision-making, for example with our Lyft Pink subscription plan, Lyft Pass commuter programs, first-mile and last-mile services and university ride smart programs. We also provide centralized tools and enterprise transportation solutions, such as our Concierge offering, that enable organizations to manage the transportation needs of customers, employees and other constituents. Grow Active Riders. We see opportunities to continue to grow our rider base. We may make incremental investments in our brand and in growth marketing to maintain and drive increasing consumer preference for Lyft. We strive to provide a full range of price points and ride experiences such as Wait & Save, which allows riders to save money by waiting for a ride, and Priority Pickup, which provides a premium experience by allowing riders to pay for prioritized pickup. We plan to continue to grow our ridesharing marketplace by prioritizing competitive service levels and attracting and retaining more drivers and riders on our network. Additionally, we continue to evaluate ways to expand our network coverage beyond the geographies and markets we currently serve. We also believe we are a beneficiary of demographic shifts, such as the growing percentage of the U.S. population that is accustomed to on-demand services and has digital-first preferences. Grow Our Share of Consumers’ Transportation Spend. Lyft’s transportation network is designed to address a wide range of mobility needs. The Lyft network spans rideshare, bikes, and scooters and we are well positioned to deliver the best holistic experience to all of our riders and to capture significantly more of our market opportunity. Deliver Increasing Value to Drivers. We strive to provide drivers that use Lyft with the best possible experience, including access to a variety of economic opportunities. For example, through our Express Drive program, drivers can get access to rental cars they can use for ridesharing. We also provide drivers with a suite of resources, including access to our on-demand, 24/7 support through our Driver app, to ensure drivers have the resources they need before taking the road. Invest in our Marketplace Technology. Our investments in our proprietary technology allow us to deliver a convenient and high-quality experience to drivers and riders and additional investments in our payments and data science capabilities have been central to making our network more efficient and seamless to use. Competition The market for Transportation-as-a-Service (“TaaS”) networks is intensely competitive and characterized by rapid changes in technology, shifting levels of demand and frequent introductions of new services and offerings. We expect competition to continue, both from current competitors and new entrants in the market that may be well-established and enjoy greater resources or other strategic advantages. If we are unable to anticipate or successfully react to these competitive challenges in a timely manner, our competitive position could weaken, or fail to improve, and we could experience a decline in revenue or growth stagnation that could adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations. Our main ridesharing competitor in the United States and Canada is Uber, though we also compete with other ridesharing transportation network companies, and taxi cab and livery companies as well as traditional automotive manufacturers. Our main competitors in the bike and scooter sharing market include Lime, Bird, Fifteen and Tier. We also compete with other manufacturers of bike and scooter sharing equipment for sales of such equipment, particularly in markets outside of the United States. Additionally, there are other non-U.S.-based TaaS', '<7-hop>\n\nUnited States and other jurisdictions. Laws, regulations and standards governing issues such as TNCs, public companies, ridesharing, worker classification, labor and employment, anti-discrimination, payments, gift cards, whistleblowing and worker confidentiality obligations, product liability, defects, recalls, auto maintenance and repairs, personal injury, advertising, text messaging, subscription services, intellectual property, securities, consumer protection, taxation, privacy, data security, competition, unionizing and collective action, antitrust, arbitration agreements and class action waiver provisions, terms of service, mobile application accessibility, autonomous vehicles, bike and scooter sharing, insurance, vehicle rentals, money transmittal, non-emergency medical transportation, healthcare fraud, waste, and abuse, environmental health and safety, greenhouse gas emissions, background checks, public health, anti-corruption, anti-bribery, political contributions, lobbying, import and export restrictions, trade and economic sanctions, foreign ownership and investment, foreign exchange controls and delivery of goods including (but not limited to) medical supplies, perishable foods and prescription drugs are often complex and subject to varying interpretations, in many cases due to their lack of specificity. As a result, their application in practice may change or develop over time through judicial decisions or as new guidance or interpretations are provided by regulatory and governing bodies, such as federal, state and local administrative agencies. The TNC industry has also come under increasing scrutiny from non-profit organizations, regulators, and legislators for its environmental impact, specifically increasing greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions. In 2018, California passed first-of-its-kind legislation (the “California Clean Miles Standard”) to mandate that TNCs increase the percentage of zero-emission vehicles on their platforms, with additional requirements to reduce their GHG emissions on a GHG per passenger-mile basis. Policymakers have since passed similar legislation in Massachusetts and New York City to grow EV TNC rides, and may do so in other jurisdictions. See the sections titled “Business” and “Risk Factors” including the subsections titled “Business – Environmental, Social and Corporate Governance - Environmental” and “Risk Factors—Risks Related to Regulatory and Legal Factors” for additional information about the laws and regulations we are subject to and the risks to our business associated with such laws and regulations. Human Capital Our employees are our human capital and, together with our technology stack, they are our greatest strength and most valuable resource. The workplace environment has changed significantly in the last couple of years and we have changed our philosophy to reflect what we believe will produce the best results for our employees and business moving forward. Thus, in 2023, we welcomed employees back to the office and have implemented a hybrid model where employees have the flexibility to work from home. As of December 31, 2023, we had 2,945 employees and we maintain additional offices in multiple locations in the U.S. and internationally in Montreal, Canada, Mexico City, Mexico, Kyiv, Ukraine, Berlin, Germany, Munich, Germany and Minsk, Belarus. None of our employees are represented by a labor union or covered by a collective bargaining agreement. We have not experienced any work stoppages and we consider our relations with our employees to be positive. We believe that achieving more diversity in workforce representation is an important priority. We are a company with a diverse customer base, and the more our employees reflect that diversity, the better we can serve our customers, ultimately making our business stronger. As of December 31, 2023, our employee base was 57% male and 40% female, and women represented 42% of our leadership overall. The ethnicity of our U.S. employees was 46% White, 32% Asian, 9% Hispanic or Latinx, 7% Black, and 5% two or more races, American Indian, Alaska Native, Native Hawaiian or other Pacific Islander. Our employee gender and ethnicity information is based on self-identification, and employees who did not disclose their gender or ethnicity have been excluded from the applicable disclosure. As of December 31, 2023, employees who did not disclose gender represented approximately 3% of total employees, and employees who did not disclose ethnicity represented approximately 1% of total U.S. employees. We strive to build a more representative workforce which requires an intentional and comprehensive effort to reach and recruit outstanding candidates, develop talent internally, and open up pathways for advancement. We are continuing to focus on scaling and sustaining diverse partnerships and early candidate pipeline development as we believe recruiting and hiring initiatives can yield short and long-term benefits to the organization. In 2023, we continued our partnerships and outreach programs by holding partnership events with organizations that aim to increase diversity in enterprise hiring pools, such as BreakLine, Tribaja, and Disability:IN. We also maintained representation in our hiring pool through our sourcing tool, hireEZ, and held disability and inclusion training for team members with the Inclusively and Direct Employers organizations. Environmental, Social and Corporate Governance (“ESG”) We are proud of the impact we made on people and the planet in 2023, and we have reported in depth on what we have done in our 2023 ESG Report. As we grow, we’ll touch millions more lives — economically, socially, and environmentally. Environmental We have a responsibility to our shared environment — the air we breathe and the resilience of communities we serve. Our environmental impact also gives drivers and riders another great reason to choose Lyft, and is an intrinsic part of how we think about 10 our business goals. We are working to make the Lyft Platform more sustainable by helping drivers transition to EVs, riders take more sustainable modes, and businesses reduce their carbon footprint. The rides that we facilitate on our platform make up over 95% of Lyft’s carbon emissions. Transitioning these rides from gas-powered to electric vehicles is the one of the best ways we can contribute long-term toward a cleaner planet. Over 8 million riders rode in an EV in 2023. Rides in electric vehicles generally get higher ratings and tips compared to rides in hybrids and gas cars. Over 20% of rides on the Lyft Platform are currently in a hybrid or an EV. In April 2023, we launched Green, where riders can select an EV or hybrid vehicle, specifically for business travelers, and in January 2024, we expanded', '<8-hop>\n\nGreen to nearly 40 airports in North America. Because we stand at a pivotal moment in the fight against climate change, Lyft strives to grow EVs on the platform. In 2020, we made a commitment to reach 100% EVs across the Lyft Platform by the end of 2030. We still believe in the long-term transition to EVs, but now do not see a path to completing our transition to 100% EVs by 2030 given the current EV landscape. Over the course of 2024 and 2025, we will invest an additional $80 million total to support EV drivers and encourage gas-powered drivers to make the switch. We expect this investment to help us reach 100 million all-time EV rides on the platform by the end of 2025. Most of this funding will go to drivers in states that are committed to electrifying, developing infrastructure, and growing EV adoption as quickly as possible. Social Lyft’s purpose is to get people out into the world so they can live their lives together, and provide drivers a meaningful way to earn that gives them control over their time and money. We’re constantly thinking about the role we play in our customers’ lives. For riders, social interaction improves physical and mental health. We’re making it easier to get out of the house, and the hundreds of millions of rides we facilitated in 2023 connected people with friends, family, and coworkers. Everyday encounters like these help people feel happier and more connected to their community. For drivers, Lyft is part of the economic fabric of millions of lives. Drivers may be students putting themselves through college, parents looking for a way to earn while their kids are in school, or seniors interested in meeting new people. The flexibility to work on their own schedules is a core benefit of driving with Lyft, and millions of drivers use the platform to support their families or build toward their dreams. We keep working to understand who drivers are and how they use Lyft through our annual Economic Impact Report. We want to improve the lives of everyone we interact with, but know that targeted programs can have an outsized impact. Through our Lyft Up initiative, we’re working to provide riders access to affordable, reliable transportation to get where they need to go — no matter their age, income, zip, or postal code. In 2023, Lyft provided access to millions of discounted or donated rideshare, bikeshare, and shared scooter rides to people in need. We provided access to millions of discounted or donated rideshare, bikeshare, and shared scooter rides to help people in need. Some of our current Lyft Up programs assist the community by providing rides to and from jobs, job interviews and trainings, the grocery store for those living in food-insecure areas, and by providing discounted bikeshare memberships and heavily discounted electric bikes to income eligible riders. Other Lyft Up programs provide donated ride credits to resettlement agencies and other community based organizations helping refugees access essential needs and services or relief rides in the aftermath of natural or manmade disasters. Corporate Governance Our board of directors regularly evaluates our environmental, social, and corporate governance policies to make sure they fit into our strategy of driving long-term stockholder value and align with our core values. More information about our directors, executive officers and corporate governance will be included in our definitive Proxy Statement for our 2024 Annual Meeting of Stockholders. Corporate Information We were incorporated in 2007 as Bounder Web, Inc., a Delaware corporation. In 2008, we changed our name to Zimride, Inc. We founded Lyft in 2012 and changed our name to Lyft, Inc. in 2013 when we sold the assets related to our Zimride operations. 11 Available Information Our website is located at www.lyft.com, and our investor relations website is located at investor.lyft.com.

Risk Factors. Investing in our Class A common stock involves a high degree of risk. You should carefully consider the risks and uncertainties described below, together with all of the other information in this Annual Report on Form 10-K, including the section titled “Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations” and our consolidated financial statements and related notes, before making a decision to invest in our Class A common stock. Our business, financial condition, results of operations or prospects could also be harmed by risks and uncertainties not currently known to us or that we currently do not believe are material. If any of the risks actually occur, our business, financial condition, results of operations and prospects could be adversely affected. In that event, the market price of our Class A common stock could decline, and you could', '<9-hop>\n\nbelieve that our ability to compete effectively depends upon many factors both within and beyond our control, and if we are unable to compete successfully, our business, financial condition and results of operations could be adversely affected. Our results of operations vary and are unpredictable from period-to-period, which could cause the trading price of our Class A common stock to decline. Our results of operations have historically varied from period-to-period and we expect that our results of operations will continue to do so for a variety of reasons, many of which are outside of our control and difficult to predict. Because our results of operations may vary significantly from quarter-to-quarter and year-to-year, the results of any one period should not be relied upon as an indication of future performance. We have presented many of the factors that may cause our results of operations to fluctuate in this “Risk Factors” section. Fluctuations in our results of operations may cause such results to fall below our financial guidance or other projections, or the expectations of analysts or investors, which could cause the trading price of our Class A common stock to decline. The ridesharing market and the market for our other offerings, such as our network of Light Vehicles, are still in relatively early stages of growth and development and if such markets do not continue to grow, grow more slowly than we expect or fail to grow as large or otherwise develop as we expect, our business, financial condition and results of operations could be adversely affected. Prior to COVID-19, the ridesharing market grew rapidly, but it is still relatively new, and it is uncertain to what extent market acceptance will continue to grow, if at all. In addition, the market for our other offerings, such as our network of Light Vehicles, is relatively new and unproven, and it is uncertain whether demand for bike and scooter sharing will continue to grow and achieve wide market acceptance. In July 2023, we announced that we are exploring strategic alternatives for our Light Vehicles business. Our success will depend to a substantial extent on the willingness of people to widely adopt ridesharing and our other offerings across a variety of use cases. We cannot be certain whether the behavioral and social impacts of the COVID-19 pandemic will continue to negatively impact the willingness of drivers or riders to participate in ridesharing or rider demand for shared bikes or scooters, or otherwise limit market growth. In addition, in response to the COVID-19 pandemic, we paused our Shared Rides offerings, and we were temporarily restricted from operating our scooter share program in one jurisdiction due to public health and safety measures. We had to suspend or discontinue these offerings from time to time due to various concerns. In the event of significant public health concerns, such as COVID-19, or other events beyond our control, we may be required or believe it is advisable to suspend such offerings again. If the public does not perceive ridesharing or our other offerings as beneficial, or chooses not to adopt them as a result of concerns regarding public health or safety, affordability or for other reasons, whether as a result of incidents on our platform or on our competitors’ platforms, health concerns, or otherwise, then the market for our offerings may not further develop, may develop more slowly than we expect or may not achieve the growth potential we expect. Additionally, from time to time we re-evaluate the 18 markets in which we operate and the performance of our offerings, and we have discontinued and may in the future discontinue operations in certain markets as a result of such evaluations. For example, we now offer Shared Rides exclusively in connection with business-to-business partnerships and only in select markets. Any of the foregoing risks and challenges could adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations. If we fail to cost-effectively attract and retain qualified drivers on our platform, or to increase the utilization of our platform by existing drivers, our business, financial condition and results of operations could be harmed. Our continued growth depends in part on our ability to cost-effectively attract and retain qualified drivers who satisfy our screening criteria and procedures and to increase their utilization of our platform. To attract and retain qualified drivers, we have, among other things, offered sign-up and referral bonuses and provided access to third-party vehicle rental programs for drivers who do not have or do not wish to use their own vehicle. Drivers are generally able to switch between our platform and competing platforms. If we do not continue to provide drivers with flexibility on our platform, compelling opportunities to increase earnings and other incentive programs, such as demand-based bonuses, that are comparable or superior to those of our competitors and other companies in the app-based work industry or other industries, or if drivers become dissatisfied with our programs and benefits or our requirements for drivers, including requirements regarding the vehicles they drive, we may fail to attract new drivers, retain current drivers or increase their utilization of our platform, or we may experience complaints, negative publicity, strikes or other work stoppages that could adversely affect our users and our business. For example, during the COVID-19 pandemic, we experienced a shortage of available drivers relative to rider demand in certain markets and offered increased incentives to improve driver supply. Our revenue and results of operations have in prior periods been negatively impacted by supply incentives, and to the extent that driver availability remains limited and we offer increased incentives to improve supply, our revenue and results of operations may be negatively impacted in the future. Additionally, following the passage of Proposition 22 in California, drivers have been able to access the earning opportunities described in the ballot measure. In addition, in connection with a settlement with the New York Attorney General, the Company will implement certain operational changes that may entail increased costs. Further, other jurisdictions may adopt similar laws', ""<10-hop>\n\nwho drivers are and how they use Lyft through our annual Economic Impact Report.

Risk Factor Summary Our business operations are subject to numerous risks, factors and uncertainties, including those outside of our control, that could cause our actual results to be harmed, including risks regarding the following: General economic factors general macroeconomic conditions; the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic and responsive measures; natural disasters, economic downturns, public health crises or political crises; Operational factors our limited operating history; our financial performance and any inability to achieve or maintain profitability in the future; competition in our industries; the unpredictability of our results of operations and uncertainty regarding the growth of the ridesharing and other markets; our ability to attract and retain qualified drivers and riders; our insurance coverage, the adequacy of our insurance reserves, and the ability of third-party insurance providers to service our auto-related insurance claims; our reputation and brand; illegal or improper activity of users of our platform; the accuracy of background checks on potential or current drivers and our third party providers' ability to effectively conduct such background checks; changes to our pricing practices; the growth and development of our network of Light Vehicles and the quality of and supply chain for our Light Vehicles; our autonomous vehicle technology, partnerships with other companies who offer autonomous vehicle technologies, and the overall development of the autonomous vehicle industry; claims from riders, drivers or third parties; our ability to manage our growth; actual or perceived security or privacy breaches or incidents and resulting interruptions in our availability or the availability of other systems and providers; our reliance on third parties, such as Amazon Web Services, vehicle rental partners, payment processors and other service providers; our ability to operate our Express Drive program; our nascent advertising business, Lyft Media; our use of artificial"", '<11-hop>\n\nCompetitive Environment We compete on a global basis in highly fragmented markets. We face significant competition in each of the mobility and delivery industries globally and in the logistics industry in the United States and Canada from existing, well-established, and low-cost alternatives, and in the future we expect to face competition from new market entrants given the low barriers to entry that characterize these industries. As we and our competitors introduce new products and offerings, and as existing products evolve, we expect to become subject to additional competition. While we work to expand globally and introduce new products and offerings across a range of industries, many of our competitors remain focused on a limited number of products or on a narrow geographic scope, allowing them to develop specialized expertise and employ resources in a more targeted manner than we do. The competition we face in each of our offerings includes: Mobility. Our Mobility offering competes with personal vehicle ownership and usage, which accounts for the majority of passenger miles in the markets that we serve, and traditional transportation services, including taxicab companies and taxi-hailing services, livery and other car services. In addition, public transportation can be a superior substitute to our Mobility offering and in many cases, offers a faster and lower-cost travel option in many cities. We also compete with other ridesharing companies, including certain of our minority-owned entities, for Drivers and Riders, including Lyft, Ola, Didi, and Bolt. Delivery. Our Delivery offering competes with numerous companies in the meal, grocery and other delivery space in various regions for drivers, consumers, and merchants, including Amazon, Deliveroo, Delivery Hero, DoorDash, iFood, Instacart, Just Eat Takeaway, and Rappi. Our Delivery offering also competes with restaurants, including those that offer their own delivery and/or take-away, meal kit delivery services, grocery delivery services, and traditional grocers. Freight. Our Freight offering competes with global and North American freight brokers and managed transportation providers such as C.H. Robinson, Total Quality Logistics, XPO Logistics, Echo Global Logistics, Coyote, Transfix, DHL, and NEXT Trucking.', ""<12-hop>\n\nand Merchants with end-users to facilitate the completion of a successful ridesharing trip or delivery. In certain markets, we also generate revenue from end-users and charge a direct fee for use of the platform or in exchange for Mobility or Delivery services. Judgment is required in evaluating the presentation of revenue on a gross versus net basis based on whether we control the service provided to the end-user and are the principal in the transaction (gross), or we arrange for other parties to provide the service to the end-user and are the agent in the transaction (net). The assessment of whether we are considered the principal or the agent in a transaction could impact the accounting for certain payments and incentives provided to Drivers and end-users and change the timing and amount of revenue recognized. Driver Incentives We offer various incentive programs to Drivers. Judgment is required to determine the appropriate classification of these incentives. Incentives provided to customers are recorded as a reduction of revenue if we do not receive a distinct service in exchange or cannot reasonably estimate the fair value of the service received. Incentives offered in exchange for specific services, such as referral services are recorded as sales and marketing expenses. End-User Discounts and Promotions We offer discounts and promotions to end-users (that are not customers) to encourage use of our platform. Judgment is required to determine the appropriate classification of these incentives. End-user discounts and promotions are recorded to sales and marketing expenses with the exception of market-wide promotions which are recorded as a reduction of revenue. Business Combinations We allocate the fair value of purchase consideration to the tangible assets acquired, liabilities assumed, and intangible assets acquired based on their estimated fair values. The excess of the fair value of purchase consideration over the fair values of these identifiable assets and liabilities is recorded as goodwill. Such valuations require management to make significant estimates and assumptions, especially with respect to intangible assets. Significant estimates in valuing certain intangible assets include, but are not limited to, future expected cash flows from acquired advertiser, fleet, merchant, and end-user contracts, acquired technology, and trade names, based on expected future growth rates and margins, attrition rates, future changes in technology and royalty for similar brand licenses, useful lives, and discount rates. Management's estimates of fair value are based upon assumptions believed to be reasonable, but which are inherently uncertain and unpredictable and, as a result, actual results may differ from estimates. Allocation of purchase consideration to identifiable assets and liabilities affects our amortization expense, as acquired finite-lived intangible assets are amortized over the useful life, whereas any indefinite lived intangible assets, including goodwill, are not amortized. During the measurement period, which may be up to one year from the acquisition date, we may record adjustments to the assets acquired and liabilities assumed, with the corresponding offset to goodwill. Upon the conclusion of the measurement period, any subsequent adjustments are recorded to earnings. Investments—Non-Marketable Equity and Debt Securities We hold investments in privately held companies in the form of equity securities and debt securities without readily determinable fair values and in which we do not have a controlling interest or significant influence. Investments in equity securities without readily determinable fair values are initially recorded at cost and are subsequently adjusted to fair value for impairments and price changes from observable transactions in the same or a similar security from the same issuer. Investments in material available-for-sale debt securities are recorded initially at fair value and subsequently remeasured to fair value at each reporting date with the changes in fair value recognized in other comprehensive income (loss), net of tax. We may elect the fair value option for financial instruments and account for investments in debt and equity securities at fair value with changes reported in net income (loss) from continuing operations. Investments in privately held equity and debt securities are valued using significant unobservable inputs or data in inactive markets. This valuation requires judgment due to the absence of market prices and inherent lack of liquidity and are classified as Level 3 in the fair value hierarchy. In determining the estimated fair value of our investments in privately held companies, we utilize the most recent data available including observed transactions such as equity financing transactions of the investees and sales of the existing shares of the investees’ securities. In addition, the determination of whether an observed transaction is similar to the equity and debt securities held by us requires significant management judgment based on the rights and preferences of the securities. We assess our investment portfolio of privately held equity and debt securities quarterly for impairment. The impairment analysis for investments in equity securities includes a qualitative analysis of factors including the investee’s financial performance, industry and market conditions, and other relevant factors. If an equity investment is considered to be impaired we will establish a new carrying value for the investment and recognize an impairment loss through our consolidated statement of operations. Investments in debt 65 securities are evaluated for impairment quarterly based on whether its fair value has declined below its amortized cost. In circumstances where we intend to sell, or are more likely than not required to sell the security before it recovers its amortized cost basis, the difference between the fair value and amortized cost is recognized as a loss in the consolidated financial statement of operations, with a corresponding write-down of the security’s amortized cost. In circumstances where neither condition exists, we then evaluate whether a decline is due to credit-related factors. The factors considered in determining whether a credit loss exists can include the extent to which fair value is less than the amortized cost basis, changes in the credit quality of the underlying loan obligor’s, credit ratings actions, as well as other factors. To determine the portion of a decline in fair value that is credit-related, we compare the present value of the expected cash flows of the security discounted at the""]","Lyft's ridesharing marketplace connects drivers with riders via the Lyft mobile application in cities across the United States and in select cities in Canada. Beyond the standard rideshare offering, riders can select a variety of other rideshare offerings which include, but are not limited to, Wait & Save, Priority Pickup, XL, Extra Comfort and Black.

"How did the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act enacted in december 2017 affect the company's tax obligations, and what was the total amount of indebtedness for borrowed money outstanding as of december 12, 2023?","['<1-hop>\n\nas a result of our acquisition of PBSC, we became an indirect party to certain partnerships and joint ventures that we did not negotiate, and with partners with whom we are less familiar. These types of transactions present certain risks; for example, we may not achieve the desired strategic, operational and financial benefits of a divestiture, partnership, joint venture or other strategic transaction, or we may have difficulty operating together with another partner or joint venturer. In addition, in light of increased interest rates and the volatility of the financial markets, it may be more difficult to find suitable acquirors or business partners, and during the pendency of a divestiture or during the integration or separation process of any strategic transaction, we may be subject to risks related to a decline in the business, loss of employees, customers, or suppliers, and the risk that the transaction does not close. Further, minority investments inherently involve a lesser degree of control over business operations, thereby potentially increasing the financial, legal, operational, regulatory, and/or compliance risks associated with the investment. In addition, we may be dependent on other persons or entities who control the entities in which we invest, including their management or controlling shareholders, and who may have business interests, strategies, or goals that are inconsistent with ours. Business decisions or other actions or omissions of the joint venture partners, controlling shareholders, management, or other persons or entities who control them may adversely affect the value of our investment or result in litigation or regulatory action against us. We can provide no assurance that our investments in other technologies or businesses will generate returns for our business, or that we will not lose our initial investment in whole or in part. For example, in October 2022, one of our autonomous vehicle partners announced its wind-down, and as a result we incurred a total impairment of $135.7 million consisting of impairments of our non-marketable equity investment in such company and other assets. If we fail to address the foregoing risks or other problems encountered in connection with past or future acquisitions of businesses, new technologies, services and other assets, strategic investments or other transactions, or if we fail to successfully integrate such acquisitions or investments, or if we are unable to successfully complete other transactions or such transactions do not meet our strategic objectives, our business, results of operations and financial condition could be adversely affected. Servicing our current and future debt may require a significant amount of cash, and we may not have sufficient cash flow from our business to pay our indebtedness. Our payment obligations under such indebtedness may limit the funds available to us, and the terms of our debt agreements may restrict our flexibility in operating our business or otherwise adversely affect our results of operations. In May 2020, we issued our 2025 Notes in a private placement to qualified institutional buyers. In addition, in connection with our acquisition of Flexdrive, which is an independently managed, wholly-owned subsidiary, Flexdrive remained responsible for its obligations under a Loan and Security Agreement, as amended, with a third-party lender, a Master Vehicle Acquisition Financing and Security Agreement, as amended, with a third-party lender and a Vehicle Procurement Agreement, as amended, with a third-party; and, following the acquisition, we continued to guarantee the payments of Flexdrive for any amounts borrowed under these agreements. As of December 31, 2023, we had $865.2 million of indebtedness for borrowed money outstanding. In November 2022, we also entered into a revolving credit facility (the “Revolving Credit Facility”) with certain lenders providing the ability to borrow an aggregate principal amount of up to $420.0 million, none of which has been drawn as of December 31, 2023, and $59.0 million in letters of credit were issued under the Revolving Credit Facility as of December 31, 2023. On December 12, 2023, we entered into an amendment to the Revolving Credit Facility which, among other things, permits us to refinance the 2025 Notes and amends certain financial covenants. See Note 10 “Debt” to our consolidated financial statements, for further information on these agreements and our outstanding debt obligations. Our ability to make scheduled payments of the principal of, to pay interest or fees on or to refinance or repay our indebtedness depends on our future performance, which is subject to economic, financial, competitive and other factors beyond our control. Our business may not generate cash flow from operations in the future sufficient to service our debt and make necessary capital expenditures. If we are unable to generate such cash flow, we may be required to adopt one or more alternatives, such as selling assets, restructuring debt or obtaining additional debt financing or equity capital on terms that may be onerous or highly dilutive. Our ability to refinance any existing or future indebtedness will depend on the capital markets, general macroeconomic conditions and our financial condition at such time. We may not be able to engage in any of these activities or engage in these activities on desirable terms, which could result in a default on our debt obligations. Events and circumstances may also occur which would cause us to not be able to satisfy applicable draw-down conditions and utilize our revolving credit facility. In addition, any of our future debt agreements may contain restrictive covenants that may prohibit us from adopting any of these alternatives. Our failure to comply with these covenants could result in an event of default which, if not cured or waived, could result in the acceleration of our debt. In addition, our indebtedness, combined with our other financial obligations and contractual commitments, could have other important consequences. For example, it could: 47 make us more vulnerable to adverse changes in general U.S. and worldwide economic, industry and competitive conditions and adverse changes in government regulation; limit our flexibility in planning for, or reacting to, changes in our business and our industry; place us at a disadvantage compared to our competitors who have less debt; limit our ability', ""<2-hop>\n\nInterest Rate Risk.” We may have exposure to materially greater than anticipated tax liabilities. The tax laws applicable to our global business activities are subject to uncertainty and can be interpreted differently by different companies. For example, we may become subject to sales tax rates in certain jurisdictions that are significantly greater than the rates we currently pay in those jurisdictions. Like many other multinational corporations, we are subject to tax in multiple U.S. and foreign jurisdictions and have structured our operations to reduce our effective tax rate. Currently, certain jurisdictions are investigating our 31 compliance with tax rules. If it is determined that we are not compliant with such rules, we could owe additional taxes. Certain jurisdictions, including Australia, Kingdom of Saudi Arabia, the UK and other countries, require that we pay any assessed taxes prior to being allowed to contest or litigate the applicability of tax assessments in those jurisdictions. These amounts could materially adversely impact our liquidity while those matters are being litigated. This prepayment of contested taxes is referred to as “pay-to-play.” Payment of these amounts is not an admission that we believe we are subject to such taxes; even when such payments are made, we continue to defend our positions vigorously. If we prevail in the proceedings for which a pay-to-play payment was made, the jurisdiction collecting the payment will be required to repay such amounts and also may be required to pay interest. Additionally, the taxing authorities of the jurisdictions in which we operate have in the past, and may in the future, examine or challenge our methodologies for valuing developed technology, which could increase our worldwide effective tax rate and harm our financial position and operating results. Furthermore, our future income taxes could be adversely affected by earnings being lower than anticipated in jurisdictions that have lower statutory tax rates and higher than anticipated in jurisdictions that have higher statutory tax rates, changes in the valuation allowance on our U.S. and Netherlands' deferred tax assets, or changes in tax laws, regulations, or accounting principles. We are subject to regular review and audit by both U.S. federal and state tax authorities, as well as foreign tax authorities, and currently face numerous audits in the United States and abroad. Any adverse outcome of such reviews and audits could have an adverse effect on our financial position and operating results. In addition, the determination of our worldwide provision for income taxes and other tax liabilities requires significant judgment by our management, and we have engaged in many transactions for which the ultimate tax determination remains uncertain. The ultimate tax outcome may differ from the amounts recorded in our financial statements and may materially affect our financial results in the period or periods for which such determination is made. Our tax positions or tax returns are subject to change, and therefore we cannot accurately predict whether we may incur material additional tax liabilities in the future, which could impact our financial position. In addition, in connection with any planned or future acquisitions, we may acquire businesses that have differing licenses and other arrangements that may be challenged by tax authorities for not being at arm’s-length or that are otherwise potentially less tax efficient than our licenses and arrangements. Any subsequent integration or continued operation of such acquired businesses may result in an increased effective tax rate in certain jurisdictions or potential indirect tax costs, which could result in us incurring additional tax liabilities or having to establish a reserve in our consolidated financial statements, and could adversely affect our financial results. Changes in global and U.S. tax legislation may adversely affect our financial condition, operating results, and cash flows. We are a U.S.-based multinational company subject to tax in multiple U.S. and foreign tax jurisdictions. Beginning on January 1, 2022, the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act (“the Act”), enacted in December 2017, eliminated the option to deduct research and development expenditures in the current period and requires taxpayers to capitalize and amortize U.S.-based and non-U.S. based research and development expenditures over five and fifteen years, respectively. This legislation has accelerated the utilization of our net operating losses in the U.S., but it has not materially impacted our current tax obligations. In August 2022, the Inflation Reduction Act (“the IRA”) was enacted to take into effect for tax years after December 31, 2022. It introduced a corporate alternative minimum tax (“CAMT”) equal to 15% of the adjusted financial statement income for large corporations with profits in excess of $1 billion and a 1% excise tax on certain share buybacks by public corporations that would be imposed on such corporations. For the year ended December 31, 2023, the IRA CAMT does not apply to the Company. It is possible that the IRA CAMT could increase our future tax liability, which could in turn adversely impact our business and future profitability. In addition, the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (“OECD”) has led international efforts among approximately 140 countries and taxing jurisdictions to propose and implement changes to numerous long-standing tax principles, including, but not limited to, a framework that imposes a minimum tax rate of 15% in each taxing jurisdiction. The process is on-going, and the impact of any changes on our future tax obligations is uncertain. Furthermore, we are unable to predict what other global or U.S. tax reforms may be proposed or enacted in the future or what effects such future changes would have on our business. Any such changes in tax legislation, regulations, policies or practices in the jurisdictions in which we operate could increase the estimated tax liability that we have expensed to date and paid or accrued on our balance sheet; affect our financial position, future operating results, cash flows, and effective tax rates where we have operations; reduce post-tax returns to our stockholders; and increase the complexity, burden, and cost of tax compliance. We could become subject to new or additional digital services taxes in one or more jurisdictions where we operate.

Evaluation of Disclosure Controls and Procedures Our management, with the participation of our principal executive officer and principal financial officer, has evaluated the effectiveness of our disclosure controls and procedures (as defined in Rules 13a-15(e) and 15d-15(e) under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended, or the Exchange Act), as of the end of the period covered by this Annual Report on Form 10-K. Based on such evaluation, our principal executive officer and principal financial officer have concluded that as of December 31, 2023, due to a deficiency related to the review of our forward-looking, non-GAAP directional commentary for fiscal year 2024 that resulted in a clerical error (the “Clerical Error”) in our press release announcing our financial results for the fourth quarter and fiscal year 2023 which was furnished with our Current Report on Form 8-K dated February 13, 2024, our disclosure controls and procedures were not effective at a reasonable assurance level. The Clerical Error was promptly corrected on our earnings call and in an updated press release and supplemental slides on February 13, 2024 and in an amendment to the Form 8-K filed with the SEC on February 14, 2024. The Clerical Error is unrelated to our internal control over financial reporting. In order to remediate the deficiency, we will design and implement additional review procedures over forward-looking directional commentary. As of February 20, 2024, we believe that the actions we have taken, and plan to take, will remediate this deficiency. Management’s Report on Internal Control over Financial Reporting Our management is responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate internal control over financial reporting (as defined in Rules 13a-15(f) and 15d-15(f) under the Exchange Act). Internal control over financial reporting is a process designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of our financial reporting and the preparation of consolidated financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles. Our management, under the supervision of our Chief Financial Officer and Chief Accounting Officer, conducted an evaluation of the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2023 based on the framework in Internal Control-Integrated Framework (2013), issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission. Based on this evaluation, management concluded that our internal control over financial reporting was effective as of December 31, 2023. The effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2023 has been audited by PricewaterhouseCoopers LLP, an independent registered public accounting firm, as stated in their report, which is included in Item 8 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K.
