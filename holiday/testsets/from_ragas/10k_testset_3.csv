For example, certain states may have a more expansive view of who qualifies as a money transmitter. Additionally, outside of the United\nStates, we could be subject to additional laws, rules and regulations related to the provision of payments and financial services, and if we expand into new\njurisdictions, the foreign regulations and regulators governing our business that we are subject to will expand as well. If we are found to be a money transmitter\nunder any applicable regulation and we are not in compliance with such regulations, we may be subject to fines or other penalties in one or more jurisdictions\nlevied by federal, state or local regulators, including state Attorneys General, as well as those levied by foreign regulators. In addition to fines, penalties for\nfailing to comply with applicable rules and regulations could include criminal and civil proceedings, forfeiture of significant assets or other enforcement\nactions. We could also be required to make changes to our business practices or compliance programs as a result of regulatory scrutiny.\n29\n']","The potential consequences of failing to achieve regulatory compliance as a money transmitter include being subject to fines or other penalties in various jurisdictions, which may be levied by federal, state, or local regulators, including state Attorneys General, as well as foreign regulators.
