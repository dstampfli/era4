Our Delivery offering competes with numerous companies in the meal, grocery and other delivery space in various regions for drivers,\nconsumers, and merchants, including Amazon, Deliveroo, Delivery Hero, DoorDash, iFood, Instacart, Just Eat Takeaway, and Rappi. Our Delivery\noffering also competes with restaurants, including those that offer their own delivery and/or take-away, meal kit delivery services, grocery delivery\nservices, and traditional grocers.\n•\nFreight. Our Freight offering competes with global and North American freight brokers and managed transportation providers such as C.H. Robinson,\nTotal Quality Logistics, XPO Logistics, Echo Global Logistics, Coyote, Transfix, DHL, and NEXT Trucking.\nGovernment Regulation\nWe operate in a particularly complex legal and regulatory environment. Our business is subject to a variety of U.S. federal, state, local and foreign laws, rules,\nand regulations, including those related to Internet activities, privacy, cybersecurity, data protection, intellectual property, competition, consumer protection,\npayments, labor and employment, transportation services, transportation network companies, licensing regulations and taxation. These laws and regulations are\nconstantly evolving and may be interpreted, applied, created, or amended, in a manner that could harm our business. Examples of certain laws and regulations we\nare subject to are described below.

Outside of the United States, certain jurisdictions have adopted similar laws, rules,\nand regulations while other jurisdictions have not adopted any laws, rules, and regulations which govern our Mobility business. Further, certain jurisdictions,\nincluding Argentina, Germany, Italy, Japan, South Korea, and Spain, six countries that we have identified as expansion markets, have adopted laws, rules, and\nregulations banning certain ridesharing products or imposing extensive operational restrictions.

The California Attorney\nGeneral, in conjunction with the city attorneys for San Francisco, Los Angeles and San Diego, filed a complaint under AB5, alleging that drivers are misclassified,\nand sought an injunction and monetary damages related to the alleged competitive advantage caused by the alleged misclassification of drivers. Although the Court\nissued a preliminary injunction enjoining Uber and Lyft from classifying drivers as independent contractors during the pendency of the lawsuit, the parties were\ngranted a stipulation to dissolve the injunction in April 2021. In November 2020, California voters approved Proposition 22, a California state ballot initiative that\nprovides a framework for drivers that use platforms like ours for independent work. Proposition 22 went into effect in December 2020 and as a result of the passage\nof Proposition 22, Drivers are able to maintain their status as independent contractors under California law, and we and our competitors are required to comply with\nthe provisions of Proposition 22.

Drivers\nenter into terms of service (“ToS”) with us in order to use our Lyft Driver App.\nWe provide a service to drivers to complete a successful transportation service for riders. This service includes on-demand lead generation that assists\ndrivers to find, receive and fulfill on-demand requests from riders seeking transportation services and related collection activities using our Lyft Platform. As a\nresult, our single performance obligation in the transaction is to connect drivers with riders to facilitate the completion of a successful transportation service for\nriders.\nWe evaluate the presentation of revenue on a gross versus net basis based on whether we act as a principal by controlling the transportation service\nprovided to the rider or whether we act as an agent by arranging for third parties to provide the service to the rider. We facilitate the provision of a\ntransportation service by a driver to a rider (the driver’s customer) in order for the driver to fulfill their contractual promise to the rider. The driver fulfills their\npromise to provide a transportation service to their customer through use of the Lyft Platform. While we facilitate setting the price for transportation services,\nthe drivers and riders have the discretion in accepting the transaction price through the platform. We do not control the transportation services being provided to\nthe rider nor do we have inventory risk related to the transportation services. As a result, we act as an agent in facilitating the ability for a driver to provide a\ntransportation service to a rider.\nWe report revenue on a\xa0net basis, reflecting the service fees and commissions owed to us from the drivers as revenue, and not the gross amount\ncollected from the rider. We made this determination of not being primarily responsible for the services since we do not promise the transportation services, do\nnot contract with drivers to provide transportation services on our behalf, do not control whether the driver accepts or declines the transportation request via the\nLyft Platform, and do not control the provision of transportation services by drivers to riders at any point in time either before, during, or after, the trip.\nWe consider the ToS and our customary business practices in identifying the contracts under ASC 606. As our customary business practice, a contract\nexists between the driver and us when the driver’s ability to cancel the trip lapses, which typically is upon pickup of the rider. We collect the fare and related\ncharges from riders on behalf of drivers using the rider’s pre-authorized credit card or other payment mechanism and retain any fees owed to us before making\nthe remaining disbursement to drivers; thus the driver’s ability and intent to pay is not subject to significant judgment.\nWe earn service fees and commissions from the drivers either as the difference between an amount paid by a rider based on an upfront quoted fare and\nthe amount earned by a driver based on actual time and distance for the trip or as a fixed percentage of the fare charged to the rider. In an upfront quoted fare\narrangement, as we do not control the driver’s actions at any point in the transaction to limit the time and distance for the trip, we take on risks related to the\ndriver’s actions which may not be fully mitigated. We earn a variable amount from the drivers and may record a loss from a transaction, which is recorded as a\nreduction to revenue, in instances where an up-front quoted fare offered to a rider is less than the amount we are committed to pay the driver.\nWe recognize revenue upon completion of a ride as the single performance obligation is satisfied and we have the right to receive payment for the\nservices rendered upon the completion of the ride.\nWe offer various incentive programs to drivers that are recorded as reduction to revenue if we do not receive a distinct good or service in consideration\nor if we cannot reasonably estimate the fair value of goods or services received.\nIn some cases, we also earn Concierge platform fees from organizations that use our Concierge offering, which is a product that allows organizations\nto request rides for their customers and employees through our ridesharing marketplace. Concierge platform fees are earned as a fixed dollar amount per ride or\na percentage of the ride price depending on the contract and such Concierge platform fee revenue is recognized on a gross basis.\nWe recognize revenue from subscription fees paid by users to access transportation options through the Lyft Platform and mobile-based applications\nover the applicable subscription period.\nWe also recognize revenue from bikes and bike station hardware and software sales when control is transferred to the customer. These revenues are\nnot significant to the Company’s consolidated revenue.\nWe generate revenue from licensing and data access agreements']","Driver contracts are linked to revenue recognition through the terms of service (ToS) that drivers enter into to use the Lyft Platform. Revenue is recognized based on the fees paid by drivers for using the Lyft Platform offerings, and this is done in accordance with ASC 606. The Lyft Platform facilitates the connection between drivers and riders, which is essential for the completion of transportation services, thereby fulfilling the performance obligation that allows for revenue recognition.",reasoning,"[{'source': 'docs\\lyft.pdf', 'file_path': 'docs\\lyft.pdf', 'page': 57, 'total_pages': 143, 'format': 'PDF 1.4', 'title': '0001759509-24-000019', 'author': 'EDGAR® Online LLC, a subsidiary of OTC Markets Group', 'subject': 'Form 10-K filed on 2024-02-20 for the period ending 2023-12-31', 'keywords': '0001759509-24-000019; ; 10-K', 'creator': 'EDGAR Filing HTML Converter', 'producer': 'EDGRpdf Service w/ EO.Pdf 22.0.40.0', 'creationDate': ""D:20240220060533-05'00'"", 'modDate': ""D:20240220060544-05'00'"", 'trapped': '', 'encryption': 'Standard V2 R3 128-bit RC4'}]",True

We receive significant media coverage, including negative\npublicity regarding our brand and reputation, and while we have taken significant steps to rehabilitate our brand and reputation, failure to maintain and\nenhance our brand and reputation will cause our business to suffer.\n•\nOur historical workplace culture and forward-leaning approach created operational, compliance, and cultural challenges and our efforts to address these\nchallenges may not be successful.\n•\nIf we are unable to optimize our organizational structure or effectively manage our growth, our financial performance and future prospects will be\nadversely affected.\n•\nPlatform users may engage in, or be subject to, criminal, violent, inappropriate, or dangerous activity that results in major safety incidents, which may\nharm our ability to attract and retain Drivers, consumers, merchants, Shippers, and Carriers.\n•\nWe are making substantial investments in new offerings and technologies, and may increase such investments in the future.

15,What risks do businesses face from changing cross-border data laws?,"['adopt, similar laws that provide new consumer privacy rights and business operational requirements. Brazil provides another example, having passed the General\nData Protection Law (Lei Geral de Proteção de Dados Pessoais, or LGPD) in 2018, which is now in effect. These laws may be subject to amendments and\nregulations that may change over time, or result in additional follow-on laws such as the California Privacy Rights Act (“CPRA”) passed in California in November\n2020. For further information on risks related to our use of automated decision making and automated processing, see the risk factor titled “—Our growing use of\nartificial intelligence and machine learning may present additional risks, including risks associated with algorithm development or use, the data sets used, and/or a\ncomplex, developing regulatory environment.”\nAdditionally, we are subject to laws, rules, and regulations regarding cross-border transfers of personal data, including laws relating to transfer of personal data\noutside the EEA. We rely on transfer mechanisms permitted under these laws. Such mechanisms have received heightened regulatory and judicial scrutiny and have\nundergone modifications, and a 2020 decision by the Court of Justice of the European Union had cast doubt on the adequacy of all of the formerly-approved\nmechanisms for transferring personal data from countries in the EEA to certain other countries such as the United States. While in July 2023 the European\nCommission deemed a new EU-US Data Privacy Framework adequate for personal data transfers from the EU (and the rest of the EEA) to the US, this Framework\nhas been challenged. If we cannot rely on existing mechanisms for transferring personal data from the EEA, the United Kingdom, or other jurisdictions, we may be\nunable to transfer personal data of Drivers, consumers, or employees in those regions, which could have an adverse effect on our business, financial condition, and\noperating results, and result in substantial fines, enforcement actions, litigation, injunctive relief, and other penalties that may be costly or that may impact our\nbusiness. In addition, we may be required to disclose personal data pursuant to demands from government agencies, including from state and city regulators as a\nrequirement for obtaining or maintaining a license or otherwise, from law enforcement agencies, and from intelligence agencies. This disclosure or potential\ndisclosure may result in a failure or perceived failure by us to comply with privacy and data protection policies, notices, laws, rules, and regulations, could result in\nproceedings or actions against us in the same or other jurisdictions, and could have an adverse impact on our reputation and brand. In addition, Careem has\nhistorically shared certain user data with certain government authorities, which conflicts with our global policies regarding data use, sharing, and ownership. We\nexpect to maintain our data use, sharing, and ownership practices for both our business and Careem’s business, and doing so may cause our relationship with\ngovernment authorities in certain jurisdictions to suffer, and may result in such government authorities assessing fines or penalties against us. Further, if any\njurisdiction in which we operate changes its laws, rules, or regulations relating to data residency or local computation such that we are unable to comply in a timely\nmanner or at all, we may risk losing our rights to operate in such jurisdictions. This could adversely affect the manner in which we provide our products and\nofferings and thus materially affect our operations and financial results.\nSuch data protection laws, rules, and regulations are complex and their interpretation is rapidly evolving, making implementation and enforcement, and thus\ncompliance requirements, ambiguous, uncertain, and potentially inconsistent. This includes, for example, those relating to the processing of data for purposes of\nadvertising and profile creation, which are subject to evolving disclosure, choice, and consent requirements in the EU, US states, and other jurisdictions.\nCompliance with such laws may require changes to our data collection, use, transfer, disclosure, and other processing and certain other related business practices\nand may thereby increase compliance costs or otherwise adversely affect our operations. Additionally, any failure or perceived failure by us to comply with privacy\nand data protection policies, notices, laws, rules, orders and regulations could result in proceedings or actions against us by individuals, consumer rights groups,\ngovernmental entities or agencies, or others. We could incur significant costs investigating and defending such claims and, if found liable, significant damages.\nFurther, these proceedings and any subsequent adverse outcomes may subject us to significant penalties and negative publicity. If any of these events were to occur,\nour business and financial results could be significantly disrupted and adversely affected.\nAdverse litigation judgments or settlements resulting from legal proceedings in which we may be involved could expose us to monetary damages or limit our\nability to operate our business.\nWe have in the past been, are currently, and may in the future become, involved in private actions, collective actions, investigations, and various other legal\nproceed']","Businesses face several risks from changing cross-border data laws, including the inability to transfer personal data from the EEA, the United Kingdom, or other jurisdictions, which could adversely affect their business, financial condition, and operating results.
