Our Delivery offering competes with numerous companies in the meal, grocery and other delivery space in various regions for drivers,\nconsumers, and merchants, including Amazon, Deliveroo, Delivery Hero, DoorDash, iFood, Instacart, Just Eat Takeaway, and Rappi. Our Delivery\noffering also competes with restaurants, including those that offer their own delivery and/or take-away, meal kit delivery services, grocery delivery\nservices, and traditional grocers.\n•\nFreight. Our Freight offering competes with global and North American freight brokers and managed transportation providers such as C.H. Robinson,\nTotal Quality Logistics, XPO Logistics, Echo Global Logistics, Coyote, Transfix, DHL, and NEXT Trucking.\nGovernment Regulation\nWe operate in a particularly complex legal and regulatory environment. Our business is subject to a variety of U.S. federal, state, local and foreign laws, rules,\nand regulations, including those related to Internet activities, privacy, cybersecurity, data protection, intellectual property, competition, consumer protection,\npayments, labor and employment, transportation services, transportation network companies, licensing regulations and taxation. These laws and regulations are\nconstantly evolving and may be interpreted, applied, created, or amended, in a manner that could harm our business. Examples of certain laws and regulations we\nare subject to are described below.

A large number of proposals are before various national, regional, and local legislative bodies and regulatory entities, both within\nthe United States and in foreign jurisdictions, regarding issues related to our business model.\nIn the United States, many state and local laws, rules, and regulations impose legal restrictions and other requirements on operating our Mobility products,\nincluding licensing, insurance, screening, and background check requirements. Outside of the United States, certain jurisdictions have adopted similar laws, rules,\nand regulations while other jurisdictions have not adopted any laws, rules, and regulations which govern our Mobility business. Further, certain jurisdictions,\nincluding Argentina, Germany, Italy, Japan, South Korea, and Spain, six countries that we have identified as expansion markets, have adopted laws, rules, and\nregulations banning certain ridesharing products or imposing extensive operational restrictions.

For example, California’s Assembly\nBill 5 (“AB5”), which went into effect in January 2020, codified a test to determine whether a worker is an employee under California law. The California Attorney\nGeneral, in conjunction with the city attorneys for San Francisco, Los Angeles and San Diego, filed a complaint under AB5, alleging that drivers are misclassified,\nand sought an injunction and monetary damages related to the alleged competitive advantage caused by the alleged misclassification of drivers. Although the Court\nissued a preliminary injunction enjoining Uber and Lyft from classifying drivers as independent contractors during the pendency of the lawsuit, the parties were\ngranted a stipulation to dissolve the injunction in April 2021. In November 2020, California voters approved Proposition 22, a California state ballot initiative that\nprovides a framework for drivers that use platforms like ours for independent work. Proposition 22 went into effect in December 2020 and as a result of the passage\nof Proposition 22, Drivers are able to maintain their status as independent contractors under California law, and we and our competitors are required to comply with\nthe provisions of Proposition 22.

Drivers\nenter into terms of service (“ToS”) with us in order to use our Lyft Driver App.\nWe provide a service to drivers to complete a successful transportation service for riders. This service includes on-demand lead generation that assists\ndrivers to find, receive and fulfill on-demand requests from riders seeking transportation services and related collection activities using our Lyft Platform. As a\nresult, our single performance obligation in the transaction is to connect drivers with riders to facilitate the completion of a successful transportation service for\nriders.\nWe evaluate the presentation of revenue on a gross versus net basis based on whether we act as a principal by controlling the transportation service\nprovided to the rider or whether we act as an agent by arranging for third parties to provide the service to the rider. We facilitate the provision of a\ntransportation service by a driver to a rider (the driver’s customer) in order for the driver to fulfill their contractual promise to the rider. The driver fulfills their\npromise to provide a transportation service to their customer through use of the Lyft Platform. While we facilitate setting the price for transportation services,\nthe drivers and riders have the discretion in accepting the transaction price through the platform. We do not control the transportation services being provided to\nthe rider nor do we have inventory risk related to the transportation services. As a result, we act as an agent in facilitating the ability for a driver to provide a\ntransportation service to a rider.\nWe report revenue on a\xa0net basis, reflecting the service fees and commissions owed to us from the drivers as revenue, and not the gross amount\ncollected from the rider. We made this determination of not being primarily responsible for the services since we do not promise the transportation services, do\nnot contract with drivers to provide transportation services on our behalf, do not control whether the driver accepts or declines the transportation request via the\nLyft Platform, and do not control the provision of transportation services by drivers to riders at any point in time either before, during, or after, the trip.\nWe consider the ToS and our customary business practices in identifying the contracts under ASC 606. As our customary business practice, a contract\nexists between the driver and us when the driver’s ability to cancel the trip lapses, which typically is upon pickup of the rider. We collect the fare and related\ncharges from riders on behalf of drivers using the rider’s pre-authorized credit card or other payment mechanism and retain any fees owed to us before making\nthe remaining disbursement to drivers; thus the driver’s ability and intent to pay is not subject to significant judgment.\nWe earn service fees and commissions from the drivers either as the difference between an amount paid by a rider based on an upfront quoted fare and\nthe amount earned by a driver based on actual time and distance for the trip or as a fixed percentage of the fare charged to the rider. In an upfront quoted fare\narrangement, as we do not control the driver’s actions at any point in the transaction to limit the time and distance for the trip, we take on risks related to the\ndriver’s actions which may not be fully mitigated. We earn a variable amount from the drivers and may record a loss from a transaction, which is recorded as a\nreduction to revenue, in instances where an up-front quoted fare offered to a rider is less than the amount we are committed to pay the driver.\nWe recognize revenue upon completion of a ride as the single performance obligation is satisfied and we have the right to receive payment for the\nservices rendered upon the completion of the ride.\nWe offer various incentive programs to drivers that are recorded as reduction to revenue if we do not receive a distinct good or service in consideration\nor if we cannot reasonably estimate the fair value of goods or services received.\nIn some cases, we also earn Concierge platform fees from organizations that use our Concierge offering, which is a product that allows organizations\nto request rides for their customers and employees through our ridesharing marketplace. Concierge platform fees are earned as a fixed dollar amount per ride or\na percentage of the ride price depending on the contract and such Concierge platform fee revenue is recognized on a gross basis.\nWe recognize revenue from subscription fees paid by users to access transportation options through the Lyft Platform and mobile-based applications\nover the applicable subscription period.\nWe also recognize revenue from bikes and bike station hardware and software sales when control is transferred to the customer. These revenues are\nnot significant to the Company’s consolidated revenue.\nWe generate revenue from licensing and data access agreements']","Driver contracts are linked to revenue recognition through the terms of service (ToS) that drivers enter into to use the Lyft Platform. Revenue is recognized based on the fees paid by drivers for using the Lyft Platform offerings, and this is done in accordance with ASC 606. The Lyft Platform facilitates the connection between drivers and riders, which is essential for the completion of transportation services, thereby fulfilling the performance obligation that allows for revenue recognition.",reasoning,"[{'source': 'docs\\lyft.pdf', 'file_path': 'docs\\lyft.pdf', 'page': 57, 'total_pages': 143, 'format': 'PDF 1.4', 'title': '0001759509-24-000019', 'author': 'EDGAR® Online LLC, a subsidiary of OTC Markets Group', 'subject': 'Form 10-K filed on 2024-02-20 for the period ending 2023-12-31', 'keywords': '0001759509-24-000019; ; 10-K', 'creator': 'EDGAR Filing HTML Converter', 'producer': 'EDGRpdf Service w/ EO.Pdf 22.0.40.0', 'creationDate': ""D:20240220060533-05'00'"", 'modDate': ""D:20240220060544-05'00'"", 'trapped': '', 'encryption': 'Standard V2 R3 128-bit RC4'}]",True

15,What risks do businesses face from changing cross-border data laws?,"['adopt, similar laws that provide new consumer privacy rights and business operational requirements. Brazil provides another example, having passed the General\nData Protection Law (Lei Geral de Proteção de Dados Pessoais, or LGPD) in 2018, which is now in effect. These laws may be subject to amendments and\nregulations that may change over time, or result in additional follow-on laws such as the California Privacy Rights Act (“CPRA”) passed in California in November\n2020. For further information on risks related to our use of automated decision making and automated processing, see the risk factor titled “—Our growing use of\nartificial intelligence and machine learning may present additional risks, including risks associated with algorithm development or use, the data sets used, and/or a\ncomplex, developing regulatory environment.”\nAdditionally, we are subject to laws, rules, and regulations regarding cross-border transfers of personal data, including laws relating to transfer of personal data\noutside the EEA. We rely on transfer mechanisms permitted under these laws. Such mechanisms have received heightened regulatory and judicial scrutiny and have\nundergone modifications, and a 2020 decision by the Court of Justice of the European Union had cast doubt on the adequacy of all of the formerly-approved\nmechanisms for transferring personal data from countries in the EEA to certain other countries such as the United States. While in July 2023 the European\nCommission deemed a new EU-US Data Privacy Framework adequate for personal data transfers from the EU (and the rest of the EEA) to the US, this Framework\nhas been challenged. If we cannot rely on existing mechanisms for transferring personal data from the EEA, the United Kingdom, or other jurisdictions, we may be\nunable to transfer personal data of Drivers, consumers, or employees in those regions, which could have an adverse effect on our business, financial condition, and\noperating results, and result in substantial fines, enforcement actions, litigation, injunctive relief, and other penalties that may be costly or that may impact our\nbusiness. In addition, we may be required to disclose personal data pursuant to demands from government agencies, including from state and city regulators as a\nrequirement for obtaining or maintaining a license or otherwise, from law enforcement agencies, and from intelligence agencies. This disclosure or potential\ndisclosure may result in a failure or perceived failure by us to comply with privacy and data protection policies, notices, laws, rules, and regulations, could result in\nproceedings or actions against us in the same or other jurisdictions, and could have an adverse impact on our reputation and brand. In addition, Careem has\nhistorically shared certain user data with certain government authorities, which conflicts with our global policies regarding data use, sharing, and ownership. We\nexpect to maintain our data use, sharing, and ownership practices for both our business and Careem’s business, and doing so may cause our relationship with\ngovernment authorities in certain jurisdictions to suffer, and may result in such government authorities assessing fines or penalties against us. Further, if any\njurisdiction in which we operate changes its laws, rules, or regulations relating to data residency or local computation such that we are unable to comply in a timely\nmanner or at all, we may risk losing our rights to operate in such jurisdictions. This could adversely affect the manner in which we provide our products and\nofferings and thus materially affect our operations and financial results.\nSuch data protection laws, rules, and regulations are complex and their interpretation is rapidly evolving, making implementation and enforcement, and thus\ncompliance requirements, ambiguous, uncertain, and potentially inconsistent.

We could incur significant costs investigating and defending such claims and, if found liable, significant damages.\nFurther, these proceedings and any subsequent adverse outcomes may subject us to significant penalties and negative publicity.

The difference of $243 million between the principal amount of the 2025 Convertible Notes and the liability\ncomponent (the “debt discount”) was amortized to interest expense using the effective interest method over the term of the 2025 Convertible Notes. The equity\ncomponent of the 2025 Convertible Notes was included in additional paid-in capital in the consolidated balance sheet as of December 31, 2020 and was not\nremeasured as it continued to meet the conditions for equity classification. To determine the fair value of the liability component of the 2025 Convertible Notes as\nof the pricing date, we used the binomial model with inputs of time to maturity, conversion ratio, our stock price, risk free rate and volatility.\nEffective January\xa01, 2021, we early adopted ASU 2020-06 using the modified retrospective approach. The adoption of this standard resulted in a decrease to\nadditional paid-in capital of $243 million and an increase to our 2025 Convertible Notes by the same amount.

18,What is the purpose of claims reserve valuations in the context of insurance liabilities?,"['physical damage, first party injury coverages including personal injury protection under state law and general business liabilities up to certain limits. The\nrecorded liabilities reflect the estimated cost for claims incurred but not paid and claims that have been incurred but not yet reported and any estimable\nadministrative run-out expenses related to the processing of these outstanding claim payments. Liabilities are determined on a quarterly basis by internal\nactuaries through an analysis of historical trends, and changes in claims experience, including consideration of new information and application of loss\ndevelopment factors, and frequency and severity assumptions, among other inputs and assumptions for the insurance reserves and insurance-related accruals.\nOn an annual basis or more frequently as determined by management, an independent third-party actuary will evaluate the liabilities for appropriateness with\nclaims reserve valuations.\nInsurance claims may take years to completely settle, and the Company has available limited historical loss experience because of the limited\noperational history. The Company makes certain assumptions based on currently available information and industry statistics, with the loss development factors\nas the most significant assumption related to the insurance reserves and the frequency and severity assumptions as the most significant assumptions related to\ninsurance-related accruals,\xa0and utilizes actuarial models and techniques to estimate the reserves. A number of factors can affect the actual cost of a claim,\nincluding the length of time the claim remains open, economic and healthcare cost trends and the results of related litigation. Furthermore, claims may emerge\nin future years for events that occurred in a prior year at a rate that differs from previous actuarial projections. The impact of these factors on ultimate costs for\ninsurance is difficult to estimate and could be material. However, while the Company believes that the insurance reserve and insurance-related accrual amounts\nare adequate, the ultimate liabilities may be in excess of, or less than, the amounts provided. As a result, the net amounts that will ultimately be paid to settle\nthe liabilities and when amounts will be paid may significantly vary from the estimated amounts provided for on the consolidated balance sheets. For example,\ndisruptive factors may distort data, metrics and patterns and result in rapid increases in insurance cost and reserve deficiency. These disruptive factors can\ninclude recent economic conditions and ongoing global events such as the high inflationary environment, increased litigation, and higher than expected losses\nacross the commercial auto industry. The Company continues to review its insurance estimates in a regular, ongoing process as historical loss experience\ndevelops, additional claims are reported and settled, and the legal, regulatory and economic environment evolves.\nOn April 22, 2021, PVIC entered into a Reinsurance Agreement with DARAG, under which DARAG reinsured a legacy portfolio of auto insurance\npolicies, based on reserves in place as of March 31, 2021, for $183.2\xa0million of coverage above the liabilities recorded as of that date (the “Reinsurance\nTransaction”). Under the terms of the Reinsurance Agreement, PVIC ceded to DARAG approximately $251.3\xa0million of certain legacy insurance liabilities for\npolicies underwritten during the period of October 1, 2018 to October 1, 2020, with an aggregate limit of $434.5\xa0million, for a premium of $271.5\xa0million.\nLosses ceded under the Reinsurance Agreement that exceed $271.5\xa0million, but are below the aggregate limit of $434.5\xa0million, resulted in the recognition of a\ndeferred gain liability. The deferred gain liability was amortized and recognized as a benefit to the statement of operations over the estimated remaining\nsettlement period of the ceded reserves. The settlement period of the ceded reserves was based on the life-to-date cumulative losses collected and likely extends\nover periods longer than a quarter. The amount of the deferral that was amortized was recalculated each period based on loss payments and updated estimates\nof the portfolio’s total losses. When the amount and timing of the reinsurance recoveries were uncertain, the recovery method was used to calculate the amount\nof amortization in period. The deferral of gains had a negative impact in the respective period to cost of revenue as the losses on direct liabilities were not offset\nby gains from excess benefits under the Reinsurance Agreement. The amortization of these deferred gains provided a benefit to cost of revenue over multiple\nperiods equal to the excess benefits received. Deferred gain liabilities for the Reinsurance Transaction were included in accruals and other current liabilities on\nthe consolidated balance sheets.\nOn June 21, 2022, PVIC and DARAG completed a transaction to effectively commute and settle the previous Reinsurance Agreement.

Brazil provides another example, having passed the General\nData Protection Law (Lei Geral de Proteção de Dados Pessoais, or LGPD) in 2018, which is now in effect. These laws may be subject to amendments and\nregulations that may change over time, or result in additional follow-on laws such as the California Privacy Rights Act (“CPRA”) passed in California in November\n2020. For further information on risks related to our use of automated decision making and automated processing, see the risk factor titled “—Our growing use of\nartificial intelligence and machine learning may present additional risks, including risks associated with algorithm development or use, the data sets used, and/or a\ncomplex, developing regulatory environment.”\nAdditionally, we are subject to laws, rules, and regulations regarding cross-border transfers of personal data, including laws relating to transfer of personal data\noutside the EEA. We rely on transfer mechanisms permitted under these laws. Such mechanisms have received heightened regulatory and judicial scrutiny and have\nundergone modifications, and a 2020 decision by the Court of Justice of the European Union had cast doubt on the adequacy of all of the formerly-approved\nmechanisms for transferring personal data from countries in the EEA to certain other countries such as the United States. While in July 2023 the European\nCommission deemed a new EU-US Data Privacy Framework adequate for personal data transfers from the EU (and the rest of the EEA) to the US, this Framework\nhas been challenged. If we cannot rely on existing mechanisms for transferring personal data from the EEA, the United Kingdom, or other jurisdictions, we may be\nunable to transfer personal data of Drivers, consumers, or employees in those regions, which could have an adverse effect on our business, financial condition, and\noperating results, and result in substantial fines, enforcement actions, litigation, injunctive relief, and other penalties that may be costly or that may impact our\nbusiness. In addition, we may be required to disclose personal data pursuant to demands from government agencies, including from state and city regulators as a\nrequirement for obtaining or maintaining a license or otherwise, from law enforcement agencies, and from intelligence agencies. This disclosure or potential\ndisclosure may result in a failure or perceived failure by us to comply with privacy and data protection policies, notices, laws, rules, and regulations, could result in\nproceedings or actions against us in the same or other jurisdictions, and could have an adverse impact on our reputation and brand. In addition, Careem has\nhistorically shared certain user data with certain government authorities, which conflicts with our global policies regarding data use, sharing, and ownership. We\nexpect to maintain our data use, sharing, and ownership practices for both our business and Careem’s business, and doing so may cause our relationship with\ngovernment authorities in certain jurisdictions to suffer, and may result in such government authorities assessing fines or penalties against us. Further, if any\njurisdiction in which we operate changes its laws, rules, or regulations relating to data residency or local computation such that we are unable to comply in a timely\nmanner or at all, we may risk losing our rights to operate in such jurisdictions. This could adversely affect the manner in which we provide our products and\nofferings and thus materially affect our operations and financial results.\nSuch data protection laws, rules, and regulations are complex and their interpretation is rapidly evolving, making implementation and enforcement, and thus\ncompliance requirements, ambiguous, uncertain, and potentially inconsistent.

As a result, their application in\npractice may change or develop over time through judicial decisions or as new guidance or interpretations are provided by regulatory and governing bodies,\nsuch as federal, state and local administrative agencies.\nThe ridesharing industry, Light Vehicle sharing industry and our business model are relatively nascent and rapidly evolving. When we introduced a\npeer-to-peer ridesharing marketplace in 2012, the laws and regulations in place at the time did not directly address our offerings. Laws and regulations that\nwere in existence at that time, and some that have since been adopted, were often applied to our industry and our business in a manner that limited our\nrelationships with drivers or otherwise inhibited the growth of our ridesharing marketplace. We have been proactively working with federal, state and local\ngovernments and regulatory bodies to ensure that our ridesharing marketplace and other offerings are available broadly in the United States and Canada. In part\ndue to our efforts, a large majority of U.S. states have adopted laws related to TNCs to address the unique issues of the ridesharing industry. New laws and\nregulations and changes to existing laws and regulations continue to be adopted, implemented and interpreted in response to our industry and related\ntechnologies. As we expand our business into new markets or introduce new offerings into existing markets, regulatory bodies or courts may claim that we or\nusers on our platform are subject to additional requirements, or that we are prohibited from conducting our business in certain jurisdictions, or that users on our\nplatform are prohibited from using our platform, either generally or with respect to certain offerings. Certain jurisdictions and governmental entities, including\nairports, require us to obtain permits, pay fees or comply with certain reporting and other operational requirements to provide our ridesharing, bike and scooter\nsharing, and Flexdrive offerings. These jurisdictions and governmental entities may reject our applications for permits, revoke or suspend existing or deny\nrenewals of permits to operate, delay our ability to operate, increase their fees, charge new types of fees, or impose fines and penalties, including as a result of\nerrors in, or failures to comply with, reporting or other requirements related to our product offerings.

27,What are the data breach obligations for businesses under GDPR vs. CCPA and LGPD?,"[' regarding the use of\npersonal data, strengthened individual data rights, data breach requirements, limitations on data retention, strengthened requirements for special categories of\npersonal data and pseudonymised (i.e., key-coded) data, and additional obligations for contracting with service providers that may process personal data. In\naddition, the GDPR contains a provision that individuals shall have the right not to be subject to a decision based solely on automated processing, including\nprofiling, which produces legal effects concerning them or similarly significantly affects them. Decisions by us based on AI or automated processing of data, or\ninsufficient disclosures regarding this processing, have and could impair our business and have and could subject us to lawsuits, regulatory investigations or other\nharm. The GDPR further provides that EU member states may institute additional laws and regulations impacting the processing of personal data, including (i)\nspecial categories of personal data (e.g., racial or ethnic origin, political opinions, and religious or philosophical beliefs) and (ii) profiling of individuals and\nautomated individual decision-making. Such additional laws and regulations could limit our ability to use and share personal or other data, thereby increasing our\ncosts and harming our business and financial condition. Non-compliance with the GDPR (including any non-compliance by any acquired business) is subject to\nsignificant penalties, including fines of up to the greater of €20 million or 4% of total worldwide revenue, and injunctions against the processing of personal data.\nOther jurisdictions outside the EU are similarly introducing or enhancing privacy and data security laws, rules, and regulations, including for automated processing,\ndecision making, and profiling, which will increase our compliance costs and the risks associated with non-compliance. For example, the California Consumer\nPrivacy Act (“CCPA”), which provided new privacy rights for consumers and new operational requirements for businesses, went into effect in January 2020. The\nCCPA includes a statutory damages framework and private rights of action against businesses that fail to comply with certain CCPA terms or implement reasonable\nsecurity procedures and practices to prevent data breaches. Other U.S. states have adopted, and likely will continue to\n38\n', 'adopt, similar laws that provide new consumer privacy rights and business operational requirements. Brazil provides another example, having passed the General\nData Protection Law (Lei Geral de Proteção de Dados Pessoais, or LGPD) in 2018, which is now in effect. These laws may be subject to amendments and\nregulations that may change over time, or result in additional follow-on laws such as the California Privacy Rights Act (“CPRA”) passed in California in November\n2020. For further information on risks related to our use of automated decision making and automated processing, see the risk factor titled “—Our growing use of\nartificial intelligence and machine learning may present additional risks, including risks associated with algorithm development or use, the data sets used, and/or a\ncomplex, developing regulatory environment.”\nAdditionally, we are subject to laws, rules, and regulations regarding cross-border transfers of personal data, including laws relating to transfer of personal data\noutside the EEA. We rely on transfer mechanisms permitted under these laws. Such mechanisms have received heightened regulatory and judicial scrutiny and have\nundergone modifications, and a 2020 decision by the Court of Justice of the European Union had cast doubt on the adequacy of all of the formerly-approved\nmechanisms for transferring personal data from countries in the EEA to certain other countries such as the United States. While in July 2023 the European\nCommission deemed a new EU-US Data Privacy Framework adequate for personal data transfers from the EU (and the rest of the EEA) to the US, this Framework\nhas been challenged. If we cannot rely on existing mechanisms for transferring personal data from the EEA, the United Kingdom, or other jurisdictions, we may be\nunable to transfer personal data of Drivers, consumers, or employees in those regions, which could have an adverse effect on our business, financial condition, and\noperating results, and result in substantial fines, enforcement actions, litigation, injunctive relief, and other penalties that may be costly or that may impact our\nbusiness. In addition, we may be required to disclose personal data pursuant to demands from government agencies, including from state and city regulators as a\nrequirement for obtaining or maintaining a license or otherwise, from law enforcement agencies, and from intelligence agencies. This disclosure or potential\ndisclosure may result in a failure or perceived failure by us to comply with privacy and data protection policies, notices, laws, rules, and regulations, could result in\nproceedings or actions against us in the same or other jurisdictions, and could have an adverse impact on our reputation and brand. In addition, Careem has\nhistorically shared certain user data with certain government authorities, which conflicts with our global policies regarding data use, sharing, and ownership. We\nexpect to maintain our data use, sharing, and ownership practices for both our business and Careem’s business, and doing so may cause our relationship with\ngovernment authorities in certain jurisdictions to suffer, and may result in such government authorities assessing fines or penalties against us. Further, if any\njurisdiction in which we operate changes its laws, rules, or regulations relating to data residency or local computation such that we are unable to comply in a timely\nmanner or at all, we may risk losing our rights to operate in such jurisdictions. This could adversely affect the manner in which we provide our products and\nofferings and thus materially affect our operations and financial results.\nSuch data protection laws, rules, and regulations are complex and their interpretation is rapidly evolving, making implementation and enforcement, and thus\ncompliance requirements, ambiguous, uncertain, and potentially inconsistent. This includes, for example, those relating to the processing of data for purposes of\nadvertising and profile creation, which are subject to evolving disclosure, choice, and consent requirements in the EU, US states, and other jurisdictions.\nCompliance with such laws may require changes to our data collection, use, transfer, disclosure, and other processing and certain other related business practices\nand may thereby increase compliance costs or otherwise adversely affect our operations. Additionally, any failure or perceived failure by us to comply with privacy\nand data protection policies, notices, laws, rules, orders and regulations could result in proceedings or actions against us by individuals, consumer rights groups,\ngovernmental entities or agencies, or others. We could incur significant costs investigating and defending such claims and, if found liable, significant damages.\nFurther, these proceedings and any subsequent adverse outcomes may subject us to significant penalties and negative publicity. If any of these events were to occur,\nour business and financial results could be significantly disrupted and adversely affected.\nAdverse litigation judgments or settlements resulting from legal proceedings in which we may be involved could expose us to monetary damages or limit our\nability to operate our business.\nWe have in the past been, are currently, and may in the future become, involved in private actions, collective actions, investigations, and various other legal\nproceed']","The context does not provide specific details about the data breach obligations for businesses under GDPR, CCPA, and LGPD.

The interest rate for the Revolving Credit Facility is determined based on calculations using certain market rates as set forth in\nthe credit agreement. In addition, the Revolving Credit Facility contains restrictions on payments including cash payments of dividends. The Revolving Credit\nFacility provides for borrowings up to the amount of the facility, with a sublimit of $168\xa0million for the issuance of letters of credit. On December 12, 2023, we\nentered into an amendment to Revolving Credit Facility, which amends the existing agreement to, among other things: (i) permit us to refinance existing junior\nindebtedness (including our convertible senior notes due 2025) with proceeds from one or more new convertible debt issuance(s) or other subordinated\nindebtedness, subject to certain conditions set forth therein, (ii) permit us to repurchase up to $450.0 million of our convertible senior notes due 2025, (iii)\nextend the applicability of the existing liquidity covenant to the fiscal quarter ending June 30, 2024 and (iv) commence the date of the stepdown of the total\nleverage ratio from 3.50x to 3.00x at the fiscal quarter ending March 31, 2025.

Accordingly, we maintain no accounts receivable from drivers. Our\ncontracts with insurance providers require reinsurance premiums to be deposited into trust accounts with a third-party financial institution from which the\ninsurance providers are reimbursed for claims payments. Our restricted reinsurance trust investments were $837.3 million and $1.0 billion as of December\xa031,\n2023 and 2022, respectively.\nWe continue to actively monitor the impact of the uncertain macroeconomic environment, including tightening credit markets, inflation and changing\ninterest rates.

We\nhave also incurred restructuring charges related to the exit and sublease or cease use of certain facilities to align with our anticipated operating needs in the\nfourth quarter of 2022 and the first quarter of 2023. While we cannot be certain that our actions will mitigate the impact of the uncertain macroeconomic\nenvironment, with $1.7 billion in unrestricted cash and cash equivalents and short-term investments as of December\xa031, 2023, as well as our credit facility, we\nbelieve we have sufficient liquidity to meet our working capital and capital expenditures needs for at least the next 12 months.\nOur future capital requirements will depend on many factors, including, but not limited to our growth, our ability to attract and retain drivers and\nriders on our platform, the continuing market acceptance of our offerings, the timing and extent of spending to support our efforts to develop our platform,\nactual insurance payments for which we have made reserves, and the expansion of sales and marketing activities. Further, we may in the future enter into\narrangements to acquire or invest in businesses, products, services and technologies. For example, we intend to invest further in EVs in order to achieve\ncompliance with the California Clean Miles Standard which sets the target that 90% of rideshare miles in California must be in EVs by the end of 2030; the\nMassachusetts’ Climate Bill; New York City's goal to get to 100% of rideshare rides in EVs or wheelchair accessible vehicles by 2030, and the City of\nToronto’s push to bring the industry to 100% electric by 2030. From time to time, we may seek additional equity or debt financing to fund capital expenditures,\nstrategic initiatives or investments and our ongoing operations, or to refinance our existing or future indebtedness. In the event that we decide, or are required,\nto seek additional financing from outside sources, we may not be able to raise it on terms acceptable to us or at all. The terms of any additional financings or\nrefinancings may place limits on our financial and operating flexibility. If we raise additional funds through further issuances of equity or equity-linked\nsecurities, our existing stockholders could suffer dilution in their percentage ownership of us, and any new securities we issue could have rights, preferences\nand privileges senior to those of holders of our common stock.

29,"What factors influence deferred tax assets, given tax uncertainties and insurance reserves?","['on our assessment of the facts and circumstances at each balance sheet date and are subject to change based on new information and future events.\nThe outcomes of litigation, regulatory, indirect tax examinations and investigations are inherently uncertain. Therefore, if one or more of these matters were\nresolved against us for amounts in excess of management’s expectations, our results of operations, financial condition, or cash flows, including in a particular\nreporting period in which any such outcome becomes probable and estimable, could be materially adversely affected.\nIncome Taxes\nWe are subject to income taxes in the United States and foreign jurisdictions. We account for income taxes using the asset and liability method. The\nestablishment of deferred tax assets from intra-entity transfers of intangible assets requires management to make significant estimates and assumptions to determine\nthe fair value of such intangible assets. Significant estimates in valuing intangible assets may include, but are not necessarily limited to, internal revenue and\nexpense forecasts, the estimated life of the intangible assets, comparable transaction values, and/or discount rates. The discount rates used to discount expected\nfuture cash flows to present value are derived from a weighted-average cost of capital analysis and are adjusted to reflect the inherent risks related to the cash flow.\nAlthough we believe the assumptions and estimates we have made are reasonable and appropriate, they are based, in part, on historical experience, internal and\nexternal comparable data and are inherently uncertain. Unanticipated events and circumstances may occur that could affect either the accuracy or validity of such\nassumptions, estimates or actual results.\nWe account for uncertainty in tax positions by recognizing a tax benefit from uncertain tax positions when it is more-likely-than-not that the position will be\nsustained upon examination. Evaluating our uncertain tax positions and determining our provision for income taxes are inherently uncertain and require making\njudgments, assumptions, and estimates. While we believe we have adequately reserved for our uncertain tax positions, no assurance can be given that the final tax\noutcome of these matters will not be different. We adjust these reserves in light of changing facts and circumstances, such as the closing of a tax audit. To the extent\nthat the final tax outcome of these matters is different than the amounts recorded, such differences may impact the provision for income taxes and the effective tax\nrate in the period in which such determination is made.\nThe provision for income taxes includes the impact of reserve provisions and changes to reserves as well as the related net interest and penalties. In addition,\nwe are subject to the continuous examination of our income tax returns by the IRS and other tax authorities which may assert assessments against us. We regularly\nassess the likelihood of adverse outcomes resulting from these examinations and assessments to determine the adequacy of our provision for income taxes.\nBased on available evidence, management believes it is not more-likely-than-not that the net U.S., Netherlands, and other non-material jurisdictions’ deferred\ntax assets will be fully realizable. In these jurisdictions, we have recorded a valuation allowance against net deferred tax assets. We regularly review the deferred\ntax assets for recoverability based on historical taxable income, projected future taxable income, excess tax benefits related to stock-based compensation, the\nexpected timing of the reversals of existing taxable temporary differences and tax planning strategies by jurisdiction. Our judgment regarding future profitability\nmay change due to many factors, including future market conditions and the ability to successfully execute our business plans and/or tax planning strategies.\nBased on our assessment of current income and anticipated future earnings, there is a reasonable possibility that we will have sufficient evidence to release a\nsignificant portion of the valuation allowance in the U.S. within the next 12 months. However, our judgment regarding future earnings and the exact timing and\namount of any valuation allowance release are subject to change due to many factors, including future market conditions, the ability to successfully execute our\nbusiness plans, and the amount of stock-based compensation tax deductions available in the future.\nRelease of the valuation allowance would result in the recognition of net deferred tax assets on our consolidated balance sheet and would decrease income tax\nexpense in the period the release is recorded.\nInsurance Reserves\nWe use a combination of third-party insurance and self-insurance mechanisms, including a wholly-owned captive insurance subsidiary, to provide for the\npotential liabilities for certain risks, including auto liability, uninsured and underinsured motorist, auto physical damage, general liability, and workers’\ncompensation. Insurance reserves is an estimate of our potential liability for unpaid losses and loss adjustment expenses, which represents the estimate of the\nultimate unpaid obligation for risks retained by us and includes an amount for case reserves related to reported claims and an amount for losses incurred but not\nreported as of the balance sheet date. The estimate of the ultimate unpaid obligation utilizes generally accepted actuarial methods applied to historical claim and\nloss experience. In addition, we use assumptions based on actuarial judgment related to claim and loss development patterns and expected', 'experience and the nature of the coverage provided. Actual results depend upon the outcome of future contingent events and can be affected by many factors, such\nas claim settlement processes and changes in the economic, legal, and social environments. As a result, the net amounts that will ultimately be paid to settle the\nliability, and when these amounts will be paid, may vary in the near term from the estimated amounts.\nWhile management believes that the insurance reserve amount is adequate, the ultimate liability may be in excess of, or less than, the amount provided.\nRecent Accounting Pronouncements\nSee Note 1 – Description of Business and Summary of Significant Accounting Policies, to the consolidated financial statements included in Part II, Item 8,\n“Financial Statements and Supplementary Data,” of this Annual Report on Form 10-K.\nITEM 7A. QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISK\nWe are exposed to market risks in the ordinary course of our business. These risks primarily include interest rate risk, investment risk, and foreign currency\nrisk as follows:\nInterest Rate Risk\nOur exposures to market risk for changes in interest rates relate primarily to our 2030 Refinanced Term Loans. The 2030 Refinanced Term Loans represent\nfloating rate notes and are carried at amortized cost. Therefore, fluctuations in interest rates will impact our consolidated financial statements. The interest rate for\nthe 2030 Refinanced Term Loans is SOFR plus 2.75% per annum, subject to a floor of 0.00%. There is no cap on the interest rate associated with the 2030\nRefinanced Term Loans. A rising interest rate environment will increase the amount of interest paid on the 2030 Refinanced Term Loans. A hypothetical 100 basis\npoint increase or decrease in interest rates would not have a material effect on our financial results.\nThe fair value of our fixed rate notes will generally fluctuate with movements of interest rates, increasing in periods of declining rates of interest and declining\nin periods of increasing rates of interest. A hypothetical 100 basis point increase in interest rates would have decreased the fair value of our notes by $231 million\nas of December\xa031, 2023.\nInvestment Risk\nOur investment policy limits the amount of credit exposure with any one financial institution or commercial issuer. Cash deposits typically exceed insured\nlimits and are placed with financial institutions around the world that we believe are of high credit quality. These deposits are in excess of the Federal Deposit\nInsurance Corporation (“FDIC”) insurance limits. There can be no assurance that our deposits in excess of the FDIC limits will be backstopped by the U.S., or that\nany bank or financial institution with which we do business will be able to obtain needed liquidity from other banks, government institutions or by acquisition in\nthe event of a failure or liquidity crisis.\nOur investment policy objective aims to preserve capital and meet liquidity requirements without significantly increasing risk. We had cash and cash\nequivalents including restricted cash and cash equivalents totaling $6.7 billion and $7.0 billion as of December\xa031, 2022 and December\xa031, 2023, respectively.\nMarketable debt securities classified as restricted investments and short-term investments totaled $5.5 billion as of December\xa031, 2023. As of December\xa031, 2023,\nour cash, cash equivalents, and marketable debt securities primarily consist of money market funds, cash deposits, U.S. government securities, U.S. government\nagency securities, and investment-grade corporate debt securities. We do not enter into investments for trading or speculative purposes. Investments in fixed rate\nsecurities carry a degree of interest rate risk. Changes in rates would primarily impact interest income due to the relatively short-term nature of our investments. A\nhypothetical 100 basis point change in interest rates would not have a material effect on our financial results.\nWe are exposed to certain risks related to the carrying amounts of investments in other companies, including our minority-owned, privately-held entities and\npublic companies, compared to their fair value. We hold privately held investments in illiquid private company stock which are inherently difficult to value given\nthe lack of publicly available information. We also hold equity securities with readily determinable fair values which are subject to equity price risk. These\ninvestments in privately-held entities and public companies may increase the volatility in our net income/(loss) in future periods due to changes in the fair value of\nthese investments. In certain cases, our ability to sell these investments may be impacted by contractual obligations to hold the securities for a set period of time\nafter a public offering. As of December\xa031, 2023, the carrying value of these investments was $6.5 billion, including equity method investments.\nForeign Currency Risk\nWe transact business globally in multiple currencies. Our international revenue, as well as costs and expenses denominated in foreign currencies, expose us to\nthe risk']","The factors influencing deferred tax assets include management's significant estimates and assumptions regarding the fair value of intangible assets, internal revenue and expense forecasts, the estimated life of the intangible assets, comparable transaction values, and discount rates. Additionally, the recoverability of deferred tax assets is regularly reviewed based on historical taxable income, projected future taxable income, excess tax benefits related to stock-based compensation, and tax planning strategies by jurisdiction. The ultimate liability for insurance reserves is also influenced by actuarial judgment related to claim and loss development patterns and expected experience, which can affect the accuracy of estimates related to deferred tax assets.",multi_context,"[{'source': 'docs/uber.pdf', 'file_path': 'docs/uber.pdf', 'page': 68, 'total_pages': 191, 'format': 'PDF 1.4', 'title': '0001543151-24-000012', 'author': 'EDGAR® Online LLC, a subsidiary of OTC Markets Group', 'subject': 'Form 10-K filed on 2024-02-15 for the period ending 2023-12-31', 'keywords': '0001543151-24-000012; ; 10-K', 'creator': 'EDGAR Filing HTML Converter', 'producer': 'EDGRpdf Service w/ EO.Pdf 22.0.40.0', 'creationDate': ""D:20240215163245-05'00'"", 'modDate': ""D:20240215163307-05'00'"", 'trapped': '', 'encryption': 'Standard V2 R3 128-bit RC4'}, {'source': 'docs/uber.pdf', 'file_path': 'docs/uber.pdf', 'page': 69, 'total_pages': 191, 'format': 'PDF 1.4', 'title': '0001543151-24-000012', 'author': 'EDGAR® Online LLC, a subsidiary of OTC Markets Group', 'subject': 'Form 10-K filed on 2024-02-15 for the period ending 2023-12-31', 'keywords': '0001543151-24-000012; ; 10-K', 'creator': 'EDGAR Filing HTML Converter', 'producer': 'EDGRpdf Service w/ EO.Pdf 22.0.40.0', 'creationDate': ""D:20240215163245-05'00'"", 'modDate': ""D:20240215163307-05'00'"", 'trapped': '', 'encryption': 'Standard V2 R3 128-bit RC4'}]",True

31,What do TNC regs cover for driver-passenger interactions and their link to ridesharing laws?,"['ridesharing companies, including certain of our minority-owned entities, for Drivers and Riders, including Lyft, Ola, Didi, and Bolt.\n•\nDelivery. Our Delivery offering competes with numerous companies in the meal, grocery and other delivery space in various regions for drivers,\nconsumers, and merchants, including Amazon, Deliveroo, Delivery Hero, DoorDash, iFood, Instacart, Just Eat Takeaway, and Rappi. Our Delivery\noffering also competes with restaurants, including those that offer their own delivery and/or take-away, meal kit delivery services, grocery delivery\nservices, and traditional grocers.\n•\nFreight. Our Freight offering competes with global and North American freight brokers and managed transportation providers such as C.H. Robinson,\nTotal Quality Logistics, XPO Logistics, Echo Global Logistics, Coyote, Transfix, DHL, and NEXT Trucking.\nGovernment Regulation\nWe operate in a particularly complex legal and regulatory environment. Our business is subject to a variety of U.S. federal, state, local and foreign laws, rules,\nand regulations, including those related to Internet activities, privacy, cybersecurity, data protection, intellectual property, competition, consumer protection,\npayments, labor and employment, transportation services, transportation network companies, licensing regulations and taxation. These laws and regulations are\nconstantly evolving and may be interpreted, applied, created, or amended, in a manner that could harm our business. Examples of certain laws and regulations we\nare subject to are described below. For further discussion of risks relating to government regulation, see our risk factors, including the risk factors in the section\ntitled “Legal and Regulatory Risks Related to Our Business” in Part I, Item 1A of this Annual Report on Form 10-K.\nOur platform, and in particular our Mobility products, are subject to differing, and sometimes conflicting, laws, rules, and regulations in the numerous\njurisdictions in which we operate. A large number of proposals are before various national, regional, and local legislative bodies and regulatory entities, both within\nthe United States and in foreign jurisdictions, regarding issues related to our business model.\nIn the United States, many state and local laws, rules, and regulations impose legal restrictions and other requirements on operating our Mobility products,\nincluding licensing, insurance, screening, and background check requirements. Outside of the United States, certain jurisdictions have adopted similar laws, rules,\nand regulations while other jurisdictions have not adopted any laws, rules, and regulations which govern our Mobility business. Further, certain jurisdictions,\nincluding Argentina, Germany, Italy, Japan, South Korea, and Spain, six countries that we have identified as expansion markets, have adopted laws, rules, and\nregulations banning certain ridesharing products or imposing extensive operational restrictions. This uncertainty and fragmented regulatory environment creates\nsignificant complexities for our business and operating model. In addition, our Delivery and Freight products are also subject to laws, regulations and standards that\ngovern the transportation of food, alcohol and other goods.\nSubstantially all states in the United States and numerous municipalities in the United States and around the world have adopted Transportation Network\nCompany (“TNC”) regulations.\xa0These regulations generally focus on companies that operate websites or mobile apps that connect individual drivers with their own\nvehicles to passengers willing to pay to be driven to their destinations.\xa0These regulations often require TNCs to comply with rules regarding, among other things,\nbackground checks, vehicle inspections, accessible vehicles, driver and consumer safety, insurance, driver training, driver conduct, and other similar matters.\nIn addition, many jurisdictions have adopted regulations that apply to how we classify the Drivers who use our platform. For example, California’s Assembly\nBill 5 (“AB5”), which went into effect in January 2020, codified a test to determine whether a worker is an employee under California law. The California Attorney\nGeneral, in conjunction with the city attorneys for San Francisco, Los Angeles and San Diego, filed a complaint under AB5, alleging that drivers are misclassified,\nand sought an injunction and monetary damages related to the alleged competitive advantage caused by the alleged misclassification of drivers. Although the Court\nissued a preliminary injunction enjoining Uber and Lyft from classifying drivers as independent contractors during the pendency of the lawsuit, the parties were\ngranted a stipulation to dissolve the injunction in April 2021. In November 2020, California voters approved Proposition 22, a California state ballot initiative that\nprovides a framework for drivers that use platforms like ours for independent work. Proposition 22 went into effect in December 2020 and as a result of the passage\nof Proposition 22, Drivers are able to maintain their status as independent contractors under California law, and we and our competitors are required to comply with\nthe provisions of Proposition 22. In addition, many jurisdictions have municipal bodies that adopted and will adopt regulations that govern', 'payments, gift cards, whistleblowing and worker confidentiality obligations, product liability, defects, recalls, auto maintenance and repairs, personal injury,\nmarketing, advertising, text messaging, subscription services, intellectual property, AI, securities, consumer protection, taxation, privacy, data security,\ncompetition, unionizing and collective action, antitrust, arbitration agreements and class action waiver provisions, terms of service, web and mobile application\naccessibility, autonomous vehicles, bike and scooter sharing, insurance, vehicle rentals, money transmittal, non-emergency medical transportation, healthcare\nfraud, waste, and abuse, environmental health and safety, greenhouse gas emissions and EVs, background checks, public health, anti-corruption, anti-bribery,\npolitical contributions, lobbying, import and export restrictions, trade and economic sanctions, foreign ownership and investment, foreign exchange controls\nand delivery of goods are often complex and subject to varying interpretations, in many cases due to their lack of specificity. As a result, their application in\npractice may change or develop over time through judicial decisions or as new guidance or interpretations are provided by regulatory and governing bodies,\nsuch as federal, state and local administrative agencies.\nThe ridesharing industry, Light Vehicle sharing industry and our business model are relatively nascent and rapidly evolving. When we introduced a\npeer-to-peer ridesharing marketplace in 2012, the laws and regulations in place at the time did not directly address our offerings. Laws and regulations that\nwere in existence at that time, and some that have since been adopted, were often applied to our industry and our business in a manner that limited our\nrelationships with drivers or otherwise inhibited the growth of our ridesharing marketplace. We have been proactively working with federal, state and local\ngovernments and regulatory bodies to ensure that our ridesharing marketplace and other offerings are available broadly in the United States and Canada. In part\ndue to our efforts, a large majority of U.S. states have adopted laws related to TNCs to address the unique issues of the ridesharing industry. New laws and\nregulations and changes to existing laws and regulations continue to be adopted, implemented and interpreted in response to our industry and related\ntechnologies. As we expand our business into new markets or introduce new offerings into existing markets, regulatory bodies or courts may claim that we or\nusers on our platform are subject to additional requirements, or that we are prohibited from conducting our business in certain jurisdictions, or that users on our\nplatform are prohibited from using our platform, either generally or with respect to certain offerings. Certain jurisdictions and governmental entities, including\nairports, require us to obtain permits, pay fees or comply with certain reporting and other operational requirements to provide our ridesharing, bike and scooter\nsharing, and Flexdrive offerings. These jurisdictions and governmental entities may reject our applications for permits, revoke or suspend existing or deny\nrenewals of permits to operate, delay our ability to operate, increase their fees, charge new types of fees, or impose fines and penalties, including as a result of\nerrors in, or failures to comply with, reporting or other requirements related to our product offerings. Any of the foregoing actions by these jurisdictions and\ngovernmental entities could adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nRecent financial, political and other events have increased the level of regulatory scrutiny on larger companies, technology companies in general and\ncompanies engaged in dealings with independent contractors, such as ridesharing and delivery companies. Regulatory bodies may enact new laws or\npromulgate new regulations that are adverse to our business, or, due to changes in our operations and structure or partner relationships as a result of changes in\nthe market or otherwise, they may view matters or interpret laws and regulations differently than they have in the past or in a manner adverse to our business.\nSee the risk factor entitled “Challenges to contractor classification of drivers that use our platform may have adverse business, financial, tax, legal and other\nconsequences to our business.” Such regulatory scrutiny or action may create different or conflicting obligations from one jurisdiction to another, and may have\na negative outcome that could adversely affect our business, operations, financial condition, and results of operations. Additionally, we have invested and from\ntime to time we will continue to invest resources in an attempt to influence or challenge legislation and other regulatory matters pertinent to our operations,\nparticularly those related to the ridesharing industry, which may negatively impact the legal and administrative proceedings challenging the classification of\ndrivers on our platform as independent contractors if we are unsuccessful or lead to additional costs and expenses even if we are successful.

34,What does excess purchase price over net asset value suggest?,"['statements for information regarding this transaction. Refer to Note 6 “Supplemental Financial Statement Information” to the consolidated financial statements\nfor information regarding these transactions.\nStock-Based Compensation\nWe incur stock-based compensation expense primarily from RSUs, performance based stock units (“PSUs”) and stock purchase rights granted under\nour Employee Stock Purchase Plan (“ESPP”).\nWe estimate the fair value of ESPP purchase rights using the Black-Scholes option-pricing model. We recognize compensation expense related to the\nESPP purchase rights on a straight-line basis over the offering period, which is typically 12 months.\nThe fair value of RSUs and PSUs are estimated based on the fair market value of our common stock on the date of grant, which is based on the closing\nprice of our Class A common stock as reported on the date of grant.\nCompensation expense for RSUs is generally recognized based on a straight-line basis over the requisite service period. Stock-based compensation\nexpense is based on awards ultimately expected to vest and reflects estimated forfeitures. Forfeitures are estimated at the time of grant and revised, if necessary,\nin subsequent periods if actual forfeitures differ from initial estimates. As of December\xa031, 2023, the total unrecognized compensation cost related to all\nunvested awards was $203.1 million, which we expect to recognize over the remaining weighted-average period of approximately 1.2 years.\nBusiness Combinations\nWe account for our business combinations using the acquisition method of accounting, which requires, among other things, allocation of the fair value\nof purchase consideration to the tangible and intangible assets acquired and liabilities assumed at their estimated fair values on the acquisition date. The excess\nof the fair value of purchase consideration over the values of these identifiable assets and liabilities is recorded as goodwill. When determining the fair value of\nassets acquired and liabilities assumed, we make significant estimates and assumptions, especially with respect to intangible assets. Our estimates of fair value\nare based upon assumptions believed to be reasonable, but which are inherently uncertain and unpredictable and, as a result, actual results may differ from\nestimates. During the measurement period, not to exceed one year from the date of acquisition, we may record adjustments to the assets acquired and liabilities\nassumed, with a corresponding offset to goodwill if new information is obtained related to facts and circumstances that existed as of the acquisition date. After\nthe measurement period, any subsequent adjustments are reflected on the consolidated statements of operations. Acquisition costs, such as legal and consulting\nfees, are expensed as incurred.\nGoodwill\nGoodwill represents the excess of the purchase price over the fair value of the net tangible and identifiable intangible assets acquired in a business\ncombination. Intangible assets resulting from the acquisition of entities accounted for using the purchase method of accounting are estimated by us based on the\nfair value of assets received. Intangible assets are amortized on a straight-line basis over the estimated useful lives which range from two to twelve years.\nGoodwill is not subject to amortization, but is tested for impairment on an annual basis during the fourth quarter or whenever events or changes in\ncircumstances indicate the carrying amount of the goodwill may not be recoverable. As part of the annual goodwill impairment test, we first perform a\nqualitative assessment to determine whether further impairment testing is necessary. If, as a result of its qualitative assessment, it is more-likely-than-not that\nthe fair value of the reporting unit is less than its carrying amounts, the quantitative impairment test will be required. There was no impairment of goodwill\nrecorded for the years ended December\xa031, 2023, 2022 and 2021.\nRecent Accounting Pronouncements\nSee Note 2 to our consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this Annual Report on Form 10-K for recently issued accounting\npronouncements not yet adopted as of the date of this report.\xa0\nComponents of Results of Operations\nRevenue\nRevenue consists of revenue recognized from fees paid by drivers for use of our Lyft Platform offerings, Concierge platform fees from organizations\nthat use our Concierge offering, subscription fees paid by riders to access transportation options through the Lyft Platform, revenue from bikes and bike station\nhardware and software sales, revenue from licensing and data access agreements and revenue from arrangements to provide advertising services to third parties\nthat are interested in reaching users of our platform.

Such\nstructures may delay the efficiencies that we expect to gain from the acquisition and our brand and reputation could be impacted by any damage or reputational\nharm to the acquired company’s brand.\nIn addition, our acquisition of Careem has increased our risks under the U.S. Foreign Corrupt Practices Act (“FCPA”) and other similar laws outside the United\nStates. Our existing and planned safeguards, including training and compliance programs to discourage corrupt practices by such parties, may not prove effective,\nand such parties may engage in conduct for which we could be held responsible.\nWe may not receive a favorable return on investment for prior or future business combinations, and we cannot predict whether these transactions will be\naccretive to the value of our common stock.

In some cases, we have applied for and obtained licenses or permits to operate and must continue to comply with the license or permit requirements\nor risk revocation. In addition, we may not be able to maintain or renew any such license or permit. We cannot predict whether future regulatory decisions or\nlegislation in other jurisdictions may embolden or encourage other authorities to take similar actions even where we are operating according to the terms of an\nexisting license or permit.\nTraditional taxicab and car service operators in various jurisdictions continue to lobby legislators and regulators to block our Mobility products or to require us\nto comply with regulatory, insurance, record-keeping, licensing, and other requirements to which taxicab and car services are subject. For example, in January\n2019, we suspended our Mobility products in Barcelona after the regional government enacted regulations mandating minimum wait times before riders could be\npicked up by ridesharing drivers; in March 2021, we returned to Barcelona via taxis only. In December 2018, New York City’s Taxi and Limousine Commission\nimplemented a per-mile and per-minute minimum trip payment formula, designed to establish a minimum pay standard, for drivers providing for-hire services in\nNew York City, such as those provided by Drivers on our platform. These minimum rates took effect in February 2019. Since implementation, these regulations\nhave had an adverse impact on our financial performance in New York City and may continue to do so in the future. In August 2018, the New York City Council\nvoted to approve various measures to further regulate our business, including driver earning rules, licensing requirements, and a one-year freeze on new for-hire\nvehicle licenses for ridesharing services like those enabled via our platform; the freeze on for-hire vehicle licenses remains. Additionally, in November 2019, a\nballot measure to impose a surcharge on ridesharing trips in San Francisco was passed by voters in San Francisco and such surcharge took effect on January 1,\n2020. Also in January 2020, a new tax went into effect in Chicago that imposes a surcharge of up to $3 per ridesharing trip taken in Chicago. In addition, in\nOctober 2020, the Seattle City Council passed a minimum pay standard for drivers providing services on our platform that went into effect on January 1, 2021, and\nother jurisdictions have in the past considered or may consider regulations which would implement minimum wage requirements or permit drivers to negotiate for\nminimum wages while providing services on our platform.

If our arbitration agreements were found to be unenforceable, in whole or in part, or specific claims were required to be exempted from arbitration, we\ncould experience an increase in our litigation costs and the time involved in resolving such disputes, and we could face increased exposure to potentially costly\nlawsuits, each of which could adversely affect our business, financial condition, operating results, and prospects.\nWe have operations in countries known to experience high levels of corruption and were previously subject to, and may in the future be subject to, inquiries,\ninvestigations, and requests for information with respect to our compliance with a number of anti-corruption laws to which we are subject.\nWe have operations in, and have business relationships with, entities in countries known to experience high levels of corruption. We are subject to the FCPA\nand other similar laws outside the United States that prohibit improper payments or offers of payments to foreign officials, foreign political parties or candidates for\nforeign political office for the purpose of obtaining or retaining business. U.S. and non-U.S. regulators alike continue to focus on the enforcement of these laws,\nand we may be subject to additional compliance requirements to identify criminal activity and payments to sanctioned parties.

Our acquisition of Careem may further enhance this risk because users of Careem’s platform and Careem’s employees, consultants, and business partners\nmay not be familiar with, and may not have been previously subject to, these anti-corruption laws.

However, numerous jurisdictions in\nwhich we operate have conducted investigations or taken action to enforce existing licensing rules, including markets within Latin America and the Asia-Pacific\nregion, and many others, including countries in Europe, the Middle East, and Africa, have adopted or proposed new laws or regulations that require Drivers to be\nlicensed with local authorities or require us or our subsidiaries to be licensed as a transportation company. Local regulations requiring the licensing of us or Drivers\nmay adversely affect our ability to scale our business and operations. In addition, it is possible that various jurisdictions could impose caps on the number of\nlicensed Drivers or vehicles with whom we may partner or impose limitations on the maximum number of hours a Driver may work, similar to recent regulations\nthat were adopted in Spain and New York City, which have temporarily frozen new vehicle licenses for Drivers using platforms like ours. If we or Drivers become\nsubject to such caps, limitations, or licensing requirements, our business and growth prospects would be adversely impacted.\nWe may be subject to liability for the means we use to attract and onboard Drivers.\nWe operate in an industry in which the competition for Drivers is intense. In this highly competitive environment, the means we use to onboard and attract\nDrivers may be challenged by competitors, government regulators, or individual plaintiffs. For example, putative class actions have been filed by individual\nplaintiffs against us for alleged violation of the Telephone Consumer Protection Act of 1991, alleging, among other things, that plaintiffs received text messages\nfrom us regarding our Driver program without their consent or after indicating to us they no longer wished to receive such text messages. These lawsuits are\nexpensive and time consuming to defend, and, if resolved adversely to us, could result in material financial damages and penalties, costly adjustments to our\nbusiness practices, and negative publicity. In addition, we could incur substantial expense and possible loss of revenue if competitors file']","The risks of anti-corruption laws in high-corruption areas include the potential for unauthorized payments or offers of payments by various parties, such as Drivers, consumers, merchants, Shippers, Carriers, employees, consultants, or business partners, in violation of anti-corruption laws like the FCPA.

We also have audited the Company's internal control over financial reporting as of December\n31, 2023, based on criteria established in Internal Control - Integrated Framework (2013) issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway\nCommission (COSO).\nIn our opinion, the consolidated financial statements referred to above present fairly, in all material respects, the financial position of the Company as of December\n31, 2023 and 2022, and the results of its operations and its cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended December 31, 2023 in conformity with\naccounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America.

Our responsibility is to express opinions on the Company’s consolidated financial statements and on the Company's internal control over\nfinancial reporting based on our audits. We are a public accounting firm registered with the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States) (PCAOB)\nand are required to be independent with respect to the Company in accordance with the U.S. federal securities laws and the applicable rules and regulations of the\nSecurities and Exchange Commission and the PCAOB.\nWe conducted our audits in accordance with the standards of the PCAOB. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audits to obtain reasonable\nassurance about whether the consolidated financial statements are free of material misstatement, whether due to error or fraud, and whether effective internal\ncontrol over financial reporting was maintained in all material respects.\nOur audits of the consolidated financial statements included performing procedures to assess the risks of material misstatement of the consolidated financial\nstatements, whether due to error or fraud, and performing procedures that respond to those risks. Such procedures included examining, on a test basis, evidence\nregarding the amounts and disclosures in the consolidated financial statements. Our audits also included evaluating the accounting principles used and significant\nestimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall presentation of the consolidated financial statements.

Our network becomes smarter with every trip. In\nmore than 10,000 cities around the world (as of December 31, 2023), our network powers movement at the touch of a button\nfor millions, and we hope eventually billions, of people.\nLeading Technology\nWe have built proprietary marketplace, routing, and payments technologies. Marketplace technologies are the core of our deep\ntechnology advantage and include demand prediction, matching and dispatching, and pricing technologies. Our technologies\nmake it extremely efficient to launch new businesses and operationalize existing ones.\nOperational Excellence\nOur regional on-the-ground operations teams use their extensive market-specific knowledge to rapidly launch and scale\nproducts in cities, support Drivers, consumers, Merchants, Shippers, and Carriers, and build and enhance relationships with\ncities and regulators.\nProduct Expertise\nOur products are built with the expertise that allows us to set the standard for powering movement on-demand, provide\nplatform users with a contextual, intuitive interface, continually evolve features and functionality, and deliver safety and trust.\nWe intend to continue to invest in new platform offerings that we believe will further strengthen our platform and existing offerings.\nWe believe that all of these synergies serve the customer experience, enabling us to attract new platform users and to deepen engagement with existing\nplatform users. Both of these dynamics grow our network scale and liquidity, which further increases the value of our platform-to-platform users. For example,\nDelivery attracts new consumers to our network—for the three months ended December\xa031, 2023, over 60% of first-time Delivery consumers were new to our\nplatform. Additionally, for the three months ended December\xa0 31, 2023, consumers who used both Mobility and Delivery generated 10.5 Trips per month on\naverage, compared to 5.0 Trips per month on average for consumers who used a single offering in cities where both Mobility and Delivery were offered. We\nbelieve that these trends will improve as we further leverage the power of our platform.\nWith our platform, we are making it even easier for our consumers to unlock convenience. In 2020, we rolled out our “Super App” view on iOS and Android,\nwhich combines our multiple offerings into a single app and is designed to remove friction for our consumers. During November 2021, we launched Uber One in\nthe United States as our single cross-platform membership program that brings together the best of Uber. Uber One members have access to discounts, special\npricing, priority service, and exclusive perks across our rides, delivery and grocery offerings. Since then, we have expanded Uber One to approximately 25\ncountries. Our Eats Pass membership program continues to remain available in select cities as a subscription offering. Our membership programs are designed to\nmake utilizing our suite of products a seamless and rewarding experience for our consumers. We exited 2023 with 19 million members for our Uber One, Eats Pass\nand Rides Pass membership programs.\nWe are also utilizing our data and scale to offer marketplace-centric advertising to connect merchants and brands with our platform network and unlocking\ncross-platform advertising formats. During October 2022, we officially launched Uber’s advertising division and introduced Uber Journey Ads, an engaging way\nfor brands to connect with consumers throughout the entire ride process. We now offer a model that enables brands to partner with Uber on a variety of advertising\noptions on the Uber and Uber Eats apps, and beyond, while connecting with consumers in brand-safe and captivating ways. We also provide comprehensive\nreporting and analysis, which helps brands fine-tune their understanding of consumers and create more impactful campaigns as they connect with consumers at\nrelevant points throughout their journeys and transactions. During the fourth quarter of 2023, active advertising merchants exceeded 550,000. We believe that our\nadvertising further strengthens the power of our platform and will continue to do so as we onboard more advertisers.\nCompetitive Environment\nWe compete on a global basis in highly fragmented markets. We face significant competition in each of the mobility and delivery industries globally and in the\nlogistics industry in the United States and Canada from existing, well-established, and low-cost alternatives, and in the future we expect to face competition from\nnew market entrants given the low barriers to entry that characterize these industries. As we and our competitors introduce new products and offerings, and as\nexisting products evolve, we expect to become subject to additional competition.

General and administrative expenses also include certain legal\nsettlements.\n•\nDepreciation and amortization expenses primarily consist of depreciation on buildings, site improvements, computer and network equipment, software,\nleasehold improvements, furniture and fixtures, and amortization of intangible assets.\nRestructuring and Related Charges\nCosts associated with management-approved restructuring activities, including reductions in headcount, exiting a market or consolidation of facilities are\nrecognized when they are incurred and may include employee termination benefits, impairment of long-lived assets (including impairment of operating lease right-\nof-use assets), contract termination costs and accelerated lease cost for right-of-use assets that ceased to be used. We record a liability for employee termination\nbenefits either when it is probable that an employee is entitled to them and the amount of the benefits can be reasonably estimated or when management has\ncommunicated the termination plan to employees and all of the following conditions have been met: management, having the authority to approve the action,\ncommits to a plan of termination; the plan identifies the number of employees to be terminated, their job classifications and their locations, and the expected\ncompletion date; the plan establishes the terms of the benefit arrangement in sufficient detail to enable employees to determine the type and amount of benefits they\nwill receive if they are involuntarily terminated; and actions required to complete the plan indicate that it is unlikely that significant changes to the plan will be\nmade or that the plan will be withdrawn.

Costs that will continue to be incurred for the remaining term of a contract that is not a lease, and provide no economic benefits to us are recognized\nat the cease-use date. Costs associated with lease contracts are accounted for under the leasing accounting guidance or under the long-lived assets accounting\nguidance.\nRestructuring and related charges are recognized as an operating expense within the consolidated statements of operations and are classified based on our\nclassification policy for each category of operating expense. Personnel costs are classified based on each employee’s classification, lease costs (including\nimpairments of right-of-use assets) are classified in the same expense line item where each lease’s rent expense was recognized and impairment of other long-lived\nassets are recorded within general and administrative expenses.\nForeign Currency\nThe functional currency of our foreign subsidiaries is the local currency or U.S. dollar depending on the nature of the subsidiaries’ activities. Monetary assets\nand liabilities denominated in currencies other than the functional currency are remeasured to the functional currency at the exchange rate in effect at the end of the\nperiod. Gains and losses resulting from remeasurement are recorded in foreign exchange gains (losses), net within other income (expense), net in the consolidated\nstatements of operations. Subsidiary assets and liabilities with non-U.S. dollar functional currencies are translated at the month-end rate, retained earnings and other\nequity items are translated at historical rates, and revenues and expenses are translated at average exchange rates during the year. Cumulative translation\nadjustments are recorded within accumulated other comprehensive income (loss), a separate component of total equity (deficit).\nNet Income (Loss) Per Share Attributable to Common Stockholders\nWe compute net income (loss) per share using the two-class method required for participating securities. The two-class method requires income available to\ncommon stockholders for the period to be allocated between common stock and participating securities based upon their respective rights to receive dividends as if\nall income for the period had been distributed.\nOur restricted common stock, and common stock issued upon early exercise of stock options are participating securities. We consider restricted common stock\nand any shares issued upon early exercise of stock options, subject to repurchase, to be participating securities because holders of such shares have non-forfeitable\ndividend rights in the event a cash dividend is declared on common stock.\nInsurance Reserves\nWe use a combination of third-party insurance and self-insurance mechanisms, including a wholly-owned captive insurance subsidiary, to provide for the\npotential liabilities for certain risks, including auto liability, uninsured and underinsured motorist, auto physical damage, general liability, and workers’\ncompensation.
