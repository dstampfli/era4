      "{'response': AIMessage(content=\"Based on the provided Uber 10-K report excerpt, jurisdictions pose several challenges to business operations regarding regulatory compliance:\\n\\n1. **Conflicting and Differing Regulations:** Uber operates in numerous jurisdictions with varying and sometimes conflicting laws and regulations related to its business model (including Mobility, Delivery, and Freight products).  This fragmented regulatory environment creates significant complexities.\\n\\n2. **Evolving and Uncertain Regulations:**  Laws and regulations are constantly evolving, and their interpretation and application can be unpredictable. This uncertainty poses a risk to Uber's business.\\n\\n3. **Restrictions on Ridesharing:** Some jurisdictions (Argentina, Germany, Italy, Japan, South Korea, and Spain are specifically mentioned) have either banned certain ridesharing products or imposed significant operational restrictions.  This directly limits Uber's ability to operate in these markets.\\n\\n4. **Extensive Compliance Requirements:**  Many jurisdictions, particularly in the US, have implemented Transportation Network Company (TNC) regulations. These regulations impose numerous requirements on companies like Uber, covering areas such as background checks, vehicle inspections, insurance, driver training, and safety.  Compliance with these diverse and potentially stringent regulations is a significant operational challenge.\\n\\n5. **Lack of Regulation in Some Jurisdictions:** The excerpt highlights that while some jurisdictions have adopted TNC regulations, others have not. This inconsistency creates further complexity for Uber's operations and necessitates a flexible approach to compliance across different regions.\\n\\n\\nThe Lyft 10-K excerpt does not directly address jurisdictional challenges to regulatory compliance in the same detail as the Uber excerpt.  It focuses more on the risks associated with acquisitions and investments, including the potential for acquired companies to lack adequate controls and compliance procedures, and the risk of new, adverse regulations impacting acquired businesses.  However, this indirectly supports the challenges highlighted in the Uber excerpt, as acquiring companies in different jurisdictions would inherently expose Lyft to the same complexities of varying regulatory landscapes.\\n\", additional_kwargs={}, response_metadata={'prompt_feedback': {'block_reason': 0, 'safety_ratings': []}, 'finish_reason': 'STOP', 'safety_ratings': []}, id='run-c275bf85-94b8-4b9a-84de-45f18efeed5c-0', usage_metadata={'input_tokens': 2000, 'output_tokens': 389, 'total_tokens': 2389, 'input_token_details': {'cache_read': 0}}), 'context': [Document(metadata={'id': '2', 'source': 'gs://10k-docs/uber.pdf', 'company': 'Uber', 'type': '10-K', 'year': '2023', 'url': 'https://d18rn0p25nwr6d.cloudfront.net/CIK-0001543151/6fabd79a-baa9-4b08-84fe-deab4ef8415f.pdf', 'previous_segments': [], 'next_segments': [], 'relevance_score': 0.6214617490768433}, page_content='# PART I\\n\\n## Government Regulation\\n\\nWe operate in a particularly complex legal and regulatory environment. Our business is subject to a variety of U.S. federal, state, local and foreign laws, rules, and regulations, including those related to Internet activities, privacy, cybersecurity, data protection, intellectual property, competition, consumer protection, payments, labor and employment, transportation services, transportation network companies, licensing regulations and taxation. These laws and regulations are constantly evolving and may be interpreted, applied, created, or amended, in a manner that could harm our business. Examples of certain laws and regulations we are subject to are described below. For further discussion of risks relating to government regulation, see our risk factors, including the risk factors in the section titled \"Legal and Regulatory Risks Related to Our Business\" in Part I, Item 1A of this Annual Report on Form 10-K. Our platform, and in particular our Mobility products, are subject to differing, and sometimes conflicting, laws, rules, and regulations in the numerous jurisdictions in which we operate. A large number of proposals are before various national, regional, and local legislative bodies and regulatory entities, both within the United States and in foreign jurisdictions, regarding issues related to our business model. In the United States, many state and local laws, rules, and regulations impose legal restrictions and other requirements on operating our Mobility products, including licensing, insurance, screening, and background check requirements. Outside of the United States, certain jurisdictions have adopted similar laws, rules, and regulations while other jurisdictions have not adopted any laws, rules, and regulations which govern our Mobility business. Further, certain jurisdictions, including Argentina, Germany, Italy, Japan, South Korea, and Spain, six countries that we have identified as expansion markets, have adopted laws, rules, and regulations banning certain ridesharing products or imposing extensive operational restrictions. This uncertainty and fragmented regulatory environment creates significant complexities for our business and operating model. In addition, our Delivery and Freight products are also subject to laws, regulations and standards that govern the transportation of food, alcohol and other goods. Substantially all states in the United States and numerous municipalities in the United States and around the world have adopted Transportation Network Company (\"TNC\") regulations. These regulations generally focus on companies that operate websites or mobile apps that connect individual drivers with their own vehicles to passengers willing to pay to be driven to their destinations. These regulations often require TNCs to comply with rules regarding, among other things, background checks, vehicle inspections, accessible vehicles, driver and consumer safety, insurance, driver training, driver conduct, and other similar matters.'), Document(metadata={'id': '1', 'source': 'gs://10k-docs/lyft.pdf', 'company': 'lyft', 'type': '10-K', 'year': '2023', 'url': 'https://d18rn0p25nwr6d.cloudfront.net/CIK-0001759509/d576a7f4-780c-4f39-86a6-aa54b03fa2ec.pdf', 'previous_segments': [], 'next_segments': [], 'relevance_score': 0.5967373847961426}, page_content='# If we are unable to make acquisitions and investments, or successfully integrate them into our business, or if we enter into strategic transactions that do not achieve our objectives, our business, results of operations and financial condition could be adversely affected.\\n\\nAs part of our business strategy, we will continue to consider a wide array of potential strategic transactions, including acquisitions of businesses, new technologies, services and other assets, joint ventures and strategic investments that complement our business, such as our acquisition of PBSC in May 2022, as well as divestitures, partnerships and other transactions. We have previously acquired and invested in, and we continue to seek to acquire and invest in businesses, technologies, or other assets that we believe could complement or expand our business, including acquisitions of new lines of business and other opportunities that operate in relatively nascent markets.

      "What challenges does competition in technology pose for maintaining interoperability of platforms?\n",
      "{'response': AIMessage(content='Competition in the technology sector poses several challenges to maintaining platform interoperability for companies like Lyft and Uber.  Both companies\\' 10-K filings highlight these risks:\\n\\n* **Third-party actions:** Competitors or technology partners may take actions that disrupt interoperability.  This could involve changes to their products, standards, or terms of use that negatively impact the functionality or performance of Lyft\\'s and Uber\\'s platforms (Lyft 2023 10-K).  This could also include preferential treatment given to competing products or services.  Uber\\'s 2023 10-K specifically mentions reliance on open marketplaces like the Apple App Store and Google Play, and the potential for these marketplaces to change their structures or fees, impacting distribution.\\n\\n* **Evolving third-party applications and services:**  The constant evolution of third-party applications, products, and services makes it difficult for Lyft and Uber to maintain compatibility.  Modifying their platforms to ensure ongoing compatibility requires significant resources and may not always be feasible (Lyft 2023 10-K; Uber 2023 10-K).  Uber highlights the reliance on Google Maps as a critical component, emphasizing the risk if Google were to alter access or terms.\\n\\n* **Software errors and vulnerabilities:** The complexity of the software underlying these platforms increases the risk of undetected errors or vulnerabilities.  Lyft\\'s use of \"continuous deployment\" further amplifies this risk.  Errors or vulnerabilities, whether in their own code or in third-party software, could lead to negative publicity, user loss, revenue loss, security breaches, and the need for significant resources to address these issues (Lyft 2023 10-K).\\n\\n\\nIn summary, the dynamic nature of the technology landscape, coupled with reliance on third-party services and the inherent complexities of software development, creates significant challenges for maintaining the interoperability of ride-sharing platforms.

In addition, some of our competitors or technology partners may take actions which disrupt the interoperability of our platform with their own products or services, or exert strong business influence on our ability to, and the terms on which we operate and distribute our platform. As our respective products evolve, we expect the types and levels of competition to 35 increase. Should any of our competitors or technology partners modify their products, standards or terms of use in a manner that degrades the functionality or performance of our platform or is otherwise unsatisfactory to us or gives preferential treatment to competitive products or services, our products, platform, business, financial condition and results of operations could be adversely affected. Defects, errors or vulnerabilities in our applications, backend systems or other technology systems and those of third-party technology providers, or system failures and resulting interruptions in our availability or the availability of other systems and providers, could harm our reputation and brand and adversely impact our business, financial condition and results of operations. The software underlying our platform is highly complex and may contain undetected errors or vulnerabilities, some of which may only be discovered after the code has been released. We rely heavily on a software engineering practice known as \"continuous deployment,\" which refers to the frequent release of our software code, sometimes multiple times per day. This practice increases the risk that errors and vulnerabilities are present in the software code underlying our platform. The third-party software that we incorporate into our platform may also be subject to errors or vulnerability. Any errors or vulnerabilities discovered in our code or from third-party software after release could result in negative publicity, a loss of users or loss of revenue and access or other performance issues. Such vulnerabilities could also be exploited by malicious actors and result in exposure of data of users on our platform, or otherwise result in a security breach or incident. We may need to expend significant financial and development resources to analyze, correct, eliminate or work around errors or defects or to address and eliminate vulnerabilities. Any failure to timely and effectively resolve any such errors, defects or vulnerabilities could adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations as well as negatively impact our reputation or brand.'), Document(metadata={'id': '2', 'source': 'gs://10k-docs/uber.pdf', 'year': '2023', 'type': '10-K', 'company': 'Uber', 'url': 'https://d18rn0p25nwr6d.cloudfront.net/CIK-0001543151/6fabd79a-baa9-4b08-84fe-deab4ef8415f.pdf', 'previous_segments': [], 'next_segments': [], 'relevance_score': 0.7089949250221252}, page_content=\"# We rely on third parties maintaining open marketplaces to distribute our platform and to provide the software we use in certain of our products and offerings.

We cannot assure you that the marketplaces through which we distribute our platform will maintain their current structures or that such marketplaces will not charge us fees to list our applications for download. For example, Apple Inc. requires that iOS apps obtain users' permission to track their activities across third-party apps and websites. If iOS users do not grant us such permission, our ability to target those users for advertisements and to measure the effectiveness of such advertisements may be adversely affected, which could decrease the effectiveness of our advertising, and increase our costs to acquire and engage users on our platform.

We do not believe that an alternative mapping solution exists that can provide the global functionality that we require to offer our platform in all of the markets in which we operate. We do not control all mapping functions employed by our platform or Drivers using our platform, and it is possible that such mapping functions may not be reliable. If such third parties cease to provide access to the third-party software that we and Drivers use, do not provide access to such software on terms that we believe to be attractive or reasonable, or do not provide us with the most current version of such software, we may be required to seek comparable software from other sources, which may be more expensive or inferior, or may not be available at all, any of which would adversely affect our business.\\n\\n# Our business depends upon the interoperability of our platform across devices, operating systems, and third-party applications that we do not control.\\n\\nOne of the most important features of our platform is its broad interoperability with a range of devices, operating systems, and third-party applications.

This fragmented regulatory environment creates significant complexities for its operations.\\n\\n2. **Uncertainty and Evolving Regulations:**  Laws and regulations are constantly evolving, and their interpretation and application can be unpredictable. This uncertainty poses a risk to Uber's business, as new laws or interpretations could negatively impact its operations.\\n\\n3. **Restrictions on Ridesharing:** Some jurisdictions, including Argentina, Germany, Italy, Japan, South Korea, and Spain, have either banned certain ridesharing products or imposed significant operational restrictions. This limits Uber's expansion and market reach.\\n\\n4. **Extensive TNC Regulations:**  Substantially all US states and numerous municipalities worldwide have adopted Transportation Network Company (TNC) regulations. These regulations often impose requirements on background checks, vehicle inspections, insurance, driver training, and other aspects of Uber's operations, adding complexity and cost.\\n\\n5. **Lack of Regulation in Some Jurisdictions:**  The excerpt notes that some jurisdictions have not adopted any laws governing Uber's mobility business, creating a patchwork of regulatory environments that Uber must navigate.\\n\\nThe Lyft 10-K excerpt does not directly address jurisdictional challenges to regulatory compliance in the same detail as the Uber excerpt.

Our business is subject to a variety of U.S. federal, state, local and foreign laws, rules, and regulations, including those related to Internet activities, privacy, cybersecurity, data protection, intellectual property, competition, consumer protection, payments, labor and employment, transportation services, transportation network companies, licensing regulations and taxation. These laws and regulations are constantly evolving and may be interpreted, applied, created, or amended, in a manner that could harm our business. Examples of certain laws and regulations we are subject to are described below. For further discussion of risks relating to government regulation, see our risk factors, including the risk factors in the section titled \"Legal and Regulatory Risks Related to Our Business\" in Part I, Item 1A of this Annual Report on Form 10-K. Our platform, and in particular our Mobility products, are subject to differing, and sometimes conflicting, laws, rules, and regulations in the numerous jurisdictions in which we operate. A large number of proposals are before various national, regional, and local legislative bodies and regulatory entities, both within the United States and in foreign jurisdictions, regarding issues related to our business model. In the United States, many state and local laws, rules, and regulations impose legal restrictions and other requirements on operating our Mobility products, including licensing, insurance, screening, and background check requirements. Outside of the United States, certain jurisdictions have adopted similar laws, rules, and regulations while other jurisdictions have not adopted any laws, rules, and regulations which govern our Mobility business. Further, certain jurisdictions, including Argentina, Germany, Italy, Japan, South Korea, and Spain, six countries that we have identified as expansion markets, have adopted laws, rules, and regulations banning certain ridesharing products or imposing extensive operational restrictions. This uncertainty and fragmented regulatory environment creates significant complexities for our business and operating model. In addition, our Delivery and Freight products are also subject to laws, regulations and standards that govern the transportation of food, alcohol and other goods.

Varying and Conflicting Jurisdictional Regulations:**  The regulatory landscape for ridesharing is fragmented and inconsistent across different jurisdictions (state, provincial, municipal, and international).  This creates complexities in operations and compliance.  Regulations vary widely regarding licensing, insurance, driver screening, minimum earnings, and operational restrictions. Some jurisdictions even have outright bans or significant limitations on ridesharing services. (Lyft 10-K; Uber 10-K,  \"Legal and Regulatory Risks Related to Our Business\").  Uber specifically mentions several countries (Argentina, Germany, Italy, Japan, South Korea, and Spain) where regulations pose significant challenges.\\n\\n**3. Evolving Regulations and Increased Scrutiny:**  The regulatory environment is dynamic, with ongoing changes and increased scrutiny of large technology companies and those using independent contractors.  New laws and regulations could be enacted that negatively impact the business model.  This includes potential regulations related to emerging technologies like AI, as noted by Lyft\\'s mention of the proposed EU Artificial Intelligence Act. (Lyft 10-K; Uber 10-K).\\n\\n**4. Costs of Regulatory Compliance and Influence:**  Both companies acknowledge the significant resources invested in complying with existing regulations and attempting to influence or challenge legislation.  These efforts, even if successful, represent substantial costs and carry the risk of unsuccessful outcomes. (Lyft 10-K).\\n\\n**5.  Transportation Network Company (TNC) Regulations:** Uber specifically points out the widespread adoption of TNC regulations in the US and globally. These regulations often cover various aspects, including background checks, vehicle inspections, insurance, driver training, and consumer safety, adding to the compliance burden. (Uber 10-K).\\n\\n\\nIn summary, the regulatory environment presents a significant and multifaceted challenge for ridesharing companies, impacting their operational costs, legal liabilities, and overall business model.

These activities may not be successful, and any negative outcomes could adversely affect our business, operations, financial condition and results of operations. Our industry is increasingly regulated. We have been subject to intense regulatory pressure from state, provincial and municipal regulatory authorities across the United States and Canada, and a number of them have imposed limitations on ridesharing and bike and scooter sharing, and certain jurisdictions have adopted rules governing minimum driver earnings for ridesharing platforms. Other jurisdictions in which we currently operate or may want to operate have and could continue to consider legislation regulating driver earnings. We could also face similar regulatory restrictions from foreign regulators as we expand operations internationally, particularly in areas where we face competition from local incumbents. In addition, we may face regulations relating to new or developing technologies. For example, the European Commission has proposed the EU Artificial Intelligence Act, which would impose operational and regulatory requirements relating to the use of AI technologies, and other jurisdictions may adopt laws and regulations relating to AI.

A large number of proposals are before various national, regional, and local legislative bodies and regulatory entities, both within the United States and in foreign jurisdictions, regarding issues related to our business model. In the United States, many state and local laws, rules, and regulations impose legal restrictions and other requirements on operating our Mobility products, including licensing, insurance, screening, and background check requirements. Outside of the United States, certain jurisdictions have adopted similar laws, rules, and regulations while other jurisdictions have not adopted any laws, rules, and regulations which govern our Mobility business. Further, certain jurisdictions, including Argentina, Germany, Italy, Japan, South Korea, and Spain, six countries that we have identified as expansion markets, have adopted laws, rules, and regulations banning certain ridesharing products or imposing extensive operational restrictions. This uncertainty and fragmented regulatory environment creates significant complexities for our business and operating model. In addition, our Delivery and Freight products are also subject to laws, regulations and standards that govern the transportation of food, alcohol and other goods. Substantially all states in the United States and numerous municipalities in the United States and around the world have adopted Transportation Network Company (\"TNC\") regulations. These regulations generally focus on companies that operate websites or mobile apps that connect individual drivers with their own vehicles to passengers willing to pay to be driven to their destinations.

      "What challenges could an 'investment company' face in operations and financial reporting?\n",
      "{'response': AIMessage(content='Based on the provided 10-K excerpts from Uber and Lyft, investment companies face several operational and financial reporting challenges:\\n\\n**1.  Investment Company Act Compliance:**  Uber\\'s 10-K highlights the risk of being classified as an \"investment company\" under the Investment Company Act. This classification would trigger burdensome compliance requirements, restrictions on business activities (including capital structure and transactions with affiliates), and potentially necessitate asset sales with associated tax implications.  This could significantly impact the company\\'s financial condition and operational flexibility.\\n\\n**2. Complex Accounting and Reporting:** Uber\\'s 10-K notes the complexity of accounting for its business model, particularly revenue recognition.  Changes in accounting principles, business models, regulations, or SEC policies could materially alter reported financial results and necessitate changes to financial reporting processes and controls. This introduces uncertainty and potential for errors in financial reporting.\\n\\n**3. Costs and Demands of Public Company Status:** Lyft\\'s 10-K emphasizes the substantial legal, accounting, and other expenses associated with being a public company.  Compliance with the Exchange Act, Sarbanes-Oxley Act, Dodd-Frank Act, SEC regulations, and Nasdaq listing standards increases costs and demands on management\\'s time and resources.  The increased visibility also raises the risk of litigation and shareholder activism, further adding to operational and financial burdens.  Furthermore, the limited experience of some management team members in managing a public company adds to the challenges.\\n\\n**4.  Management Time Allocation:** Both documents indirectly highlight the challenge of balancing compliance demands with the day-to-day management of the business.  The significant time commitment required for regulatory compliance and investor relations could divert management\\'s attention from core business operations, potentially impacting performance.\\n\\n\\nIn summary, the primary challenges for an investment company stem from regulatory compliance (Investment Company Act), the complexities of financial reporting in a dynamic business environment, and the increased costs and management demands associated with being a publicly traded company.

In accordance with ASC 820, Fair Value Measurement (\"ASC 820\"), we use the fair value hierarchy, which prioritizes the inputs used to measure fair value. The hierarchy, as defined below, gives the highest priority to unadjusted quoted prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities and the lowest priority to unobservable inputs. The three levels of the fair value hierarchy are set forth below: Level 1 Observable inputs such as quoted prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities. Level 2 Observable inputs other than Level 1 prices such as quoted prices for similar assets or liabilities in active markets, quoted prices in markets that are not active or inputs other than the quoted prices that are observable either directly or indirectly for the full term of the assets or liabilities. Level 3 Unobservable inputs in which there is little or no market data and that are significant to the fair value of the assets or liabilities. 86 Our primary financial instruments include receivables, investments in debt and equity securities, accounts payable, accrued liabilities, long-term debt and warrants. The estimated fair value of marketable debt securities, accounts receivable, accounts payable and accrued liabilities approximates their carrying value due to the short-term maturities of these instruments.

If we determine that an entity for which we hold a contractual or ownership interest in is a VIE and that we are the primary beneficiary, we consolidate such entity in the consolidated financial statements. The primary beneficiary of a VIE is the party that meets both of the following criteria: (1) has the power to make decisions that most significantly affect the economic performance of the VIE; and (2) has the obligation to absorb losses or the right to receive benefits that in either case could potentially be significant to the VIE. Periodically, we determine whether any changes in the interest or relationship with the entity impact the determination of whether the entity is still a VIE and whether we are still the primary beneficiary. If we are not deemed to be the primary beneficiary in a VIE, we account for the investment or other variable interests in a VIE in accordance with applicable GAAP.

Restricted investments are comprised of debt security investments in commercial paper, certificates of deposit, corporate bonds and U.S. government securities which are held in trust accounts at third-party financial institutions pursuant to certain contracts with insurance providers.\\n\\n# Non-marketable Equity Securities\\n\\nThe Company has elected to measure its investments in non-marketable equity securities at cost, with remeasurements to fair value only upon the occurrence of observable transactions for identical or similar investments of the same issuer or impairment. The Company qualitatively assesses whether indicators of impairment exist. Factors considered in this assessment include the investees' financial and liquidity position, access to capital resources, and macroeconomic conditions, among others. If an impairment exists, the Company estimates the fair value of the investment by using the best information available, which may include cash flow projections or other available market data, and recognizes a loss for the amount by which the carrying value exceeds the fair value of the investment on the consolidated statements of operations.\\n\\n# Concentrations of Credit Risk\\n\\nThe Company's cash, cash equivalents and short-term investments are potentially subject to concentration of credit risk. Although the Company deposits its cash with multiple financial institutions, the deposits, at times, may exceed federally insured limits. The Company has not experienced any losses on its deposits of cash and cash equivalents. Management believes that the institutions are financially stable and, accordingly, minimal credit risk exists. The Company limits purchases of debt securities to investment-grade securities.\\n\\n## Fair Value Measurements\\n\\nThe Company measures assets and liabilities at fair value based on an expected exit price, which represents the amount that would be received on the sale of an asset or paid to transfer a liability in an orderly transaction between market participants. As such, fair value may be based on assumptions that market participants would use in pricing an asset or liability. The authoritative guidance on fair value measurements establishes a consistent framework for measuring fair value on either a recurring or nonrecurring basis, whereby inputs used in valuation techniques, are assigned a hierarchical level. The following are the hierarchical levels of inputs to measure fair value: Level 1 Observable inputs that reflect quoted prices (unadjusted) for identical assets or liabilities in active markets. Level 2 Inputs reflect quoted prices for identical assets or liabilities in markets that are not active; quoted prices for similar assets or liabilities in active markets; inputs other than quoted prices that are observable for the assets or liabilities; or inputs that are derived principally from or corroborated by observable market data by correlation or other means. Level 3 Unobservable inputs reflecting our own assumptions incorporated in valuation techniques used to determine fair value. These assumptions are required to be consistent with market participant assumptions that are reasonably available. The carrying values of the Company's accounts payable and accrued and other liabilities approximate their respective fair values due to the short period of time to payment. 89\")]}\n",

Revenue recognition depends on the type of arrangement. For single-use Light Vehicle rides, revenue is recognized upon ride completion. For Flexdrive rentals, revenue is recognized evenly over the rental period (typically seven days or less).  Costs, specifically fleet operating costs, include lease payments and other vehicle expenses.  For subleased vehicles, both sublease income and head lease expense are recognized on a gross basis.\\n\\n**Uber:** The excerpt focuses on Uber's application of ASC 842 to its leases, not directly on revenue.  It mentions that lease and non-lease components are accounted for as a single unit.  Variable lease payments (e.g., utilities, taxes) are recognized in operating expenses when the obligation is incurred.  For operating leases, lease expense is recognized straight-line over the lease term.  For finance leases, expense is recognized as depreciation (straight-line) and interest (effective interest method).

Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements\\n\\n## Rental Revenue (ASC 842)\\n\\nThe Company generates rental revenues primarily from Flexdrive and its network of Light Vehicles. Rental revenues are recognized for rental and rental related activities where an identified asset is transferred to the customer and the customer has the ability to control that asset in accordance with ASC 842. The Company operates a fleet of rental vehicles through its independently managed subsidiary, Flexdrive, comprised of both owned vehicles and vehicles leased from third-party leasing companies. The Company either leases or subleases vehicles to drivers, and as a result, the Company considers itself to be the accounting lessor or sublessor, as applicable, in these arrangements in accordance with ASC 842. Fleet operating costs include monthly fixed lease payments and other vehicle operating or ownership costs, as applicable. For vehicles that are subleased, sublease income and head lease expense for these transactions are recognized on a gross basis on the consolidated financial statements. Drivers who rent vehicles are charged rental fees, which the Company collects from the driver by deducting such amounts from the driver's earnings on the Lyft Platform. 84 The Company owns and operates its Light Vehicles in some cities and operates city-owned Light Vehicles in other cities. Though the specific terms of arrangements with cities vary, the Company earns operations fees from cities or shares revenue generated by the systems with cities. Light Vehicle revenue is accounted for under ASC 842 for single-use rides. A single-use ride allows the user to select a specific Light Vehicle at the time the arrangement is entered into and provides the user the right to control the selected Light Vehicle for the desired term of the arrangement. Due to the short-term nature of the Flexdrive and Light Vehicle transactions, the Company classifies these rentals as operating leases. Revenue generated from single-use ride fees paid by Light Vehicle riders is recognized upon completion of each related ride.

We made a policy election not to separate non-lease components from lease components, therefore, we account for lease and non-lease components as a single lease component. We also elected the short-term lease recognition exemption for all leases that qualify. We determine if a contract contains a lease at inception of the arrangement based on whether we have the right to obtain substantially all of the economic benefits from the use of an identified asset and whether we have the right to direct the use of an identified asset in exchange for consideration, which relates to an asset which we do not own. Right of use (\"ROU\") assets represent our right to use an underlying asset for the lease term and lease liabilities represent our obligation to make lease payments arising from the lease. ROU assets are recognized as the lease liability, adjusted for lease incentives received. Lease liabilities are recognized at the present value of the future lease payments at the lease commencement date. The interest rate used to determine the present value of the future lease payments is our incremental borrowing rate (“IBR\"), because the interest rate implicit in most of our leases is not readily determinable. The IBR is a hypothetical rate based on our understanding of what our credit rating would be to borrow and resulting interest we would pay to borrow an amount equal to the lease payments in a similar economic environment over the lease term on a collateralized basis. Lease payments may be fixed or variable; however, only fixed payments or in-substance fixed payments are included in our lease liability calculation. Variable lease payments may include costs such as common area maintenance, utilities, real estate taxes or other costs. Variable lease payments are recognized in operating expenses in the period in which the obligation for those payments are incurred. Operating leases are included in operating lease ROU assets, operating lease liabilities, current and operating lease liabilities, non-current on our consolidated balance sheets. Finance leases are included in property and equipment, net, accrued and other current liabilities, and other long-term liabilities on our consolidated balance sheets. For operating leases, lease expense is recognized on a straight-line basis in operations over the lease term. For finance leases, lease expense is recognized as depreciation and interest; depreciation on a straight-line basis over the lease term and interest using the effective interest method.

Litigation Risks:**  Both companies note the possibility of costly and time-consuming litigation to protect their IP.  This includes the risk of facing defenses, counterclaims, and countersuits challenging the validity of their IP rights.  The outcome of such litigation is uncertain and could result in the impairment or loss of IP, further impacting their competitive position.\\n\\n**4. Competitor Actions:**  The agreements may not prevent competitors from independently developing similar or superior technologies.  Furthermore, competitors might attempt to access and exploit data, compromising trade secrets and other IP rights.  This risk is explicitly mentioned by Lyft.\\n\\n**5. Difficulty in Detecting and Preventing Infringement:**  Both companies acknowledge the challenges in detecting IP theft, particularly given the potential for reverse engineering or unauthorized copying.  Even if infringement is detected, successful enforcement is not guaranteed, and the process can be expensive and distracting.  Uber highlights the risk of operating in countries with inadequate IP protection.\\n\\nIn summary, joint development agreements introduce complexities in IP ownership and control, potentially increasing costs, diverting resources, and exposing companies to legal challenges.  The resulting limitations on the ability to protect and commercialize IP can significantly impact a company's competitive landscape.  The risk of competitors independently developing similar technologies or exploiting compromised IP further exacerbates these challenges.\\n\", additional_kwargs={}, response_metadata={'prompt_feedback': {'block_reason': 0, 'safety_ratings': []}, 'finish_reason': 'STOP', 'safety_ratings': []}, id='run-a2cf2228-9b31-41bb-a575-fd84c73c1f9f-0', usage_metadata={'input_tokens': 1942, 'output_tokens': 474, 'total_tokens': 2416, 'input_token_details': {'cache_read': 0}}), 'context': [Document(metadata={'id': '1', 'source': 'gs://10k-docs/lyft.pdf', 'company': 'lyft', 'type': '10-K', 'year': '2023', 'url': 'https://d18rn0p25nwr6d.cloudfront.net/CIK-0001759509/d576a7f4-780c-4f39-86a6-aa54b03fa2ec.pdf', 'previous_segments': [], 'next_segments': [], 'relevance_score': 0.6602307558059692}, page_content=\"# Failure to protect or enforce our intellectual property rights could harm our business, financial condition and results of operations.\\n\\nFurther, these agreements may not prevent our competitors from independently developing technologies that are substantially equivalent or superior to our offerings.

      "What risks might employee classification and competition pose to business stability?\n",
      "{'response': AIMessage(content='Based on the provided 10-K excerpts from Uber (2023) and Lyft (2023), here\\'s an analysis of the risks posed by employee classification and competition to business stability:\\n\\n**Employee Classification:**\\n\\n* **Uber:**  The Uber 10-K explicitly states that classifying drivers as employees (instead of independent contractors) would \"adversely affect our business, financial condition, operating results, or prospects.\"  This highlights a significant risk stemming from potential legal challenges and the substantial increase in operational costs associated with employee benefits, taxes, and other employment-related obligations.\\n\\n* **Lyft:** The Lyft 10-K doesn\\'t directly address the risk of driver misclassification in the same explicit manner as Uber. However, the document emphasizes the importance of attracting, retaining, and motivating personnel.  The risk of increased compensation costs to retain employees, coupled with the potential for legal challenges related to worker classification, is implicitly present.\\n\\n\\n**Competition:**\\n\\n* **Uber:** The Uber 10-K describes the mobility, delivery, and logistics industries as \"highly competitive,\" with low barriers to entry and well-capitalized competitors.  The company acknowledges that to remain competitive, it may need to continue lowering fares or service fees and offering significant incentives, potentially impacting profitability.  Failure to attract or maintain a critical mass of drivers and consumers due to competition is identified as a key risk.\\n\\n* **Lyft:** While not as explicitly detailed as in Uber\\'s report, Lyft\\'s 10-K implicitly addresses competitive pressures through its discussion of attracting and retaining highly qualified personnel.  The need for competitive compensation and benefits packages, and the potential negative impact of a declining stock price on attracting and retaining talent, directly relate to the competitive landscape.  The document also highlights the risk of increased attrition if the company cannot offer competitive compensation.\\n\\n\\n**Combined Risks:**\\n\\nThe risks of employee classification and competition are intertwined.  If companies are forced to reclassify workers as employees, their cost structures will significantly increase, reducing their ability to compete on price. This could lead to a loss of market share to competitors who may have lower labor costs or different business models.  The need to offer competitive compensation and benefits packages to attract and retain talent in a competitive market further exacerbates the financial pressure stemming from potential reclassification.  Both companies acknowledge the importance of maintaining a critical mass of drivers and consumers, a challenge directly influenced by both competitive pressures and the potential costs associated with employee classification.\\n', additional_kwargs={}, response_metadata={'prompt_feedback': {'block_reason': 0, 'safety_ratings': []}, 'finish_reason': 'STOP', 'safety_ratings': []}, id='run-dc0425db-dec7-4d3b-a21d-b0815b2225b8-0', usage_metadata={'input_tokens': 1704, 'output_tokens': 516, 'total_tokens': 2220, 'input_token_details': {'cache_read': 0}}), 'context': [Document(metadata={'id': '2', 'source': 'gs://10k-docs/uber.pdf', 'company': 'Uber', 'type': '10-K', 'year': '2023', 'url': 'https://d18rn0p25nwr6d.cloudfront.net/CIK-0001543151/6fabd79a-baa9-4b08-84fe-deab4ef8415f.pdf', 'previous_segments': [], 'next_segments': [], 'relevance_score': 0.5170043110847473}, page_content='# The following are some of these risks, any of which could have an adverse effect on our business financial condition, operating results, or prospects.\\n\\nOur business would be adversely affected if Drivers were classified as employees, workers or quasi-employees instead of independent contractors.

      "{'response': AIMessage(content=\"Businesses face several risks from changing cross-border data laws, primarily revolving around compliance costs and potential legal repercussions.  Based on the provided 10-K excerpts from Uber and Lyft:\\n\\n**Key Risks:**\\n\\n* **Increased Compliance Costs:**  The evolving landscape of data privacy laws, such as the GDPR, CCPA, and CPRA, necessitates significant investments in updating policies, practices, and technology to ensure compliance.  This includes higher consent standards, robust data disclosures, strengthened data security measures, and potentially changes to data processing methods to accommodate restrictions on automated decision-making and profiling.  Both Uber and Lyft highlight the substantial costs associated with meeting these requirements.\\n\\n* **Non-Compliance Penalties:** Failure to comply with these regulations can result in substantial financial penalties.  The GDPR, for example, imposes fines up to €20 million or 4% of global revenue, while the CCPA includes a statutory damages framework and allows for private lawsuits.  The risk of non-compliance extends to acquired businesses as well, as noted by Uber.\\n\\n* **Reputational Damage:**  Even if technically compliant, perceived failures to protect user data can severely damage a company's reputation, leading to decreased user trust and potentially impacting business growth.  Both Lyft and Uber mention that the perception of privacy or security concerns, regardless of validity, can negatively affect their business.\\n\\n* **Legal Actions:**  Non-compliance or data breaches can lead to lawsuits from both governmental agencies and private individuals, resulting in significant legal costs and potential financial liabilities.  Lyft explicitly mentions the risk of fines, proceedings, and private claims resulting from data security failures.\\n\\n* **Limitations on Data Use:**  Stringent data privacy laws may restrict how companies collect, use, and share personal data, potentially hindering business operations and impacting the development of new products or services that rely on data analysis.  Uber notes that additional laws and regulations could limit their ability to use and share data, increasing costs and harming their business.\\n\\n* **Uncertainty in Interpretation and Application:**  The evolving nature and sometimes ambiguous interpretation of these laws create uncertainty for businesses, making it challenging to fully comply and potentially leading to unforeseen legal challenges.  Lyft highlights the substantial uncertainty surrounding the interpretation and application of laws like the CCPA and CPRA.\\n\\n\\nIn summary, the changing landscape of cross-border data laws presents a significant challenge for businesses, requiring proactive and ongoing efforts to ensure compliance, manage risks, and mitigate potential negative consequences.

The EU adopted the GDPR in 2016, and it became effective in May 2018. The GDPR applies extraterritorially and imposes stringent requirements for controllers and processors of personal data. Such requirements include higher consent standards to process personal data, robust disclosures regarding the use of personal data, strengthened individual data rights, data breach requirements, limitations on data retention, strengthened requirements for special categories of personal data and pseudonymised (i.e., key-coded) data, and additional obligations for contracting with service providers that may process personal data. In addition, the GDPR contains a provision that individuals shall have the right not to be subject to a decision based solely on automated processing, including profiling, which produces legal effects concerning them or similarly significantly affects them. Decisions by us based on AI or automated processing of data, or insufficient disclosures regarding this processing, have and could impair our business and have and could subject us to lawsuits, regulatory investigations or other harm. The GDPR further provides that EU member states may institute additional laws and regulations impacting the processing of personal data, including (i) special categories of personal data (e.g., racial or ethnic origin, political opinions, and religious or philosophical beliefs) and (ii) profiling of individuals and automated individual decision-making. Such additional laws and regulations could limit our ability to use and share personal or other data, thereby increasing our costs and harming our business and financial condition. Non-compliance with the GDPR (including any non-compliance by any acquired business) is subject to significant penalties, including fines of up to the greater of €20 million or 4% of total worldwide revenue, and injunctions against the processing of personal data. Other jurisdictions outside the EU are similarly introducing or enhancing privacy and data security laws, rules, and regulations, including for automated processing, decision making, and profiling, which will increase our compliance costs and the risks associated with non-compliance. For example, the California Consumer Privacy Act (\"CCPA\"), which provided new privacy rights for consumers and new operational requirements for businesses, went into effect in January 2020.

The difference between the principal amount of the notes and the fair value of the liability component was termed the \"debt discount.\"  This discount was amortized to interest expense over the life of the notes using the effective interest method.  For Uber, this amounted to $243 million, while for Lyft, it was $189.2 million (the difference between the par value and the fair value of the liability component).\\n\\n**After ASU 2020-06:** Both companies adopted this accounting standard, resulting in a change in how convertible notes are treated.  The notes are now accounted for as a single liability measured at amortized cost.  This eliminates the separate equity component and the subsequent amortization of the debt discount as interest expense.  The impact was a decrease in additional paid-in capital and an increase in the carrying value of the convertible notes.  For Uber, this resulted in a $243 million decrease to additional paid-in capital and a corresponding increase to the 2025 Convertible Notes. For Lyft, the adoption resulted in a net decrease to additional paid-in capital of approximately $140 million (net of tax), and an increase in the carrying value of the 2025 Notes of approximately $133.5 million (net of issuance costs).  Lyft also saw an increase to its accumulated deficit of approximately $6.5 million (net of tax).\\n\\nIn essence, the significance of the debt discount lies in its impact on interest expense and the classification of the convertible notes on the balance sheet.

We may redeem for cash all or any portion of the notes, at our option, on or after December 20, 2023 if the last reported sale price of our common stock has been at least 130% of the conversion price then in effect for at least 20 trading days (whether or not consecutive) 107 during any 30 consecutive trading day period (including the last trading day of such period) ending on, and including, the trading day immediately preceding the date on which we provide notice of redemption at a redemption price equal to 100% of the principal amount of the notes to be redeemed, plus accrued and unpaid special interest, if any, to, but excluding, the redemption date. The indenture governing the 2025 Convertible Notes does not contain any financial or operating covenants or restrictions on the payments of dividends, the incurrence of indebtedness or the issuance or repurchase of securities by us or any of our subsidiaries. Prior to the adoption of ASU 2020-06, the proceeds from the issuance of the 2025 Convertible Notes were allocated between the conversion feature recorded as equity and the liability for the notes themselves. The difference of $243 million between the principal amount of the 2025 Convertible Notes and the liability component (the \"debt discount\") was amortized to interest expense using the effective interest method over the term of the 2025 Convertible Notes. The equity component of the 2025 Convertible Notes was included in additional paid-in capital in the consolidated balance sheet as of December 31, 2020 and was not remeasured as it continued to meet the conditions for equity classification. To determine the fair value of the liability component of the 2025 Convertible Notes as of the pricing date, we used the binomial model with inputs of time to maturity, conversion ratio, our stock price, risk free rate and volatility. Effective January 1, 2021, we early adopted ASU 2020-06 using the modified retrospective approach. The adoption of this standard resulted in a decrease to additional paid-in capital of $243 million and an increase to our 2025 Convertible Notes by the same amount. At adoption, there was no adjustment recorded to the opening accumulated deficit.

Additionally in the event of a corporate event constituting a fundamental change (as defined in the Indenture), holders of the 2025 Notes may require the Company to repurchase all or a portion of their 2025 Notes at a repurchase price equal to 100% of the principal amount of the 2025 Notes being repurchased, plus any accrued and unpaid interest to, but excluding, the repurchase date. Prior to the adoption of ASU 2020-06, the Company separated the 2025 Notes into a liability and an equity component. At the date of issuance, the Company determined the fair value of the liability component to be $558.3 million calculated as the present value of future cash flows discounted at the borrowing rate for a similar nonconvertible debt instrument. The equity component representing the conversion option was $189.2 million and was determined by deducting the fair value of the liability component from the par value of the 2025 Notes. The equity component is not remeasured as long as it continues to meet the conditions for equity classification. The difference between the principal amount of the 2025 Notes and the liability component (\"debt discount\") was amortized to interest expense over the contractual term at an effective interest rate of 8.0%. Following the adoption of ASU 2020-06 on January 1, 2022, the Company no longer bifurcates the 2025 Notes, but rather accounts for the conversion feature as a single debt instrument. The difference between the carrying amount and face value of the liability results in a reduced liability component. Therefore, less interest expense is being recorded each period from January 1, 2022 to maturity and the equity component is now classified as debt, eliminating the subsequent amortization of the debt discount as interest expense. Accordingly, the Company recorded a net decrease to additional paid-in capital of approximately $140.0 million, net of tax, to remove the equity component separately recorded for the conversion features associated with the 2025 Notes and equity component associated with the issuance costs, an increase of approximately $133.5 million in the carrying value of the 2025 Notes to reflect the full principal amount, net of issuance costs, and an increase to accumulated deficit of approximately $6.5 million, net of tax in the Company\\'s consolidated balance sheet with no impact to the Company\\'s consolidated statements of operations. Debt issuance costs related to the 2025 Notes totaled $14.3 million at inception and were comprised of discounts and commissions payable to the initial purchasers and third-party offering costs and will be amortized to interest expense using the effective interest method over the contractual term. As of December 31, 2023, the unamortized debt discount and debt issuance cost of the 2025 Notes was 4.0 million on the consolidated balance sheet.')]}\n",

Uber's report highlights that their insurance reserves represent the estimate of the ultimate unpaid obligation for retained risks.  The estimation uses generally accepted actuarial methods applied to historical claim and loss experience, along with management assumptions about claim and loss development patterns and expected loss costs.

The recorded liabilities reflect the estimated cost for claims incurred but not paid and claims that have been incurred but not yet reported and any estimable administrative run-out expenses related to the processing of these outstanding claim payments. Liabilities are determined on a quarterly basis by internal actuaries through an analysis of historical trends, changes in claims experience including consideration of new information and application of loss development factors for the insurance reserves and frequency and severity assumptions for the insurance-related accruals, among other inputs and assumptions. On an annual basis, an independent third-party actuary will evaluate the liabilities for appropriateness with claims reserve valuations. Insurance claims may take years to completely settle, and we have limited historical loss experience. Because of the limited operational history, we make certain assumptions based on currently available information and industry statistics, with the loss development factors as the most significant assumptions related to the insurance reserves and the frequency and severity assumptions as the most significant assumptions related to insurance-related accruals, and utilize actuarial models and techniques to estimate the reserves. A number of factors can affect the actual cost of a claim, including the length of time the claim remains open, economic and healthcare cost trends and the results of related litigation. Furthermore, claims may emerge in future years for events that occurred in a prior year at a rate that differs from previous actuarial projections. The impact of these factors on ultimate costs for insurance is difficult to estimate and could be material.

If we do not spend our development budget efficiently or effectively on commercially successful and innovative technologies, we may not realize the expected benefits of our strategy. Our new initiatives also have a high degree of risk, as each involves nascent industries and unproven business strategies and technologies with which we have limited or no prior development or operating experience.

It is also possible that products and offerings developed by others will render our products and offerings noncompetitive or obsolete. Further, our development efforts with respect to new products, offerings and technologies could distract management from current operations, and will divert capital and other resources from our more established products, offerings and technologies. Even if we are successful in developing new products, offerings or technologies, regulatory authorities may subject us to new rules or restrictions in response to our innovations that could increase our expenses or prevent us from successfully commercializing new products, offerings or technologies.

In addition, any changes in AWS' service levels may adversely affect our ability to meet the requirements of users. Since our platform's continuing and uninterrupted performance is critical to our success, sustained or repeated system failures would reduce the attractiveness of our offerings. It may become increasingly difficult to maintain and improve our performance, especially during peak usage times, as we expand and the usage of our offerings increases. Any negative publicity arising from these disruptions could harm our reputation and brand and may adversely affect the usage of our offerings. Our commercial agreement with AWS will remain in effect until terminated by AWS or us. AWS may only terminate the agreement for convenience after complying with a one-year advance notice requirement. AWS may also terminate the agreement for cause upon a breach of the agreement or for failure to pay amounts due, in each case, subject to AWS providing prior written notice and a 30-day cure period. In the event that our agreement with AWS is terminated or we add additional cloud infrastructure service providers, we may experience significant costs or downtime in connection with the transfer to, or the addition of, new cloud infrastructure service providers.

      "What impact have TNC laws had on the ridesharing industry and its business model?\n",
      "{'response': AIMessage(content=\"Based on the provided 10-K excerpts from Lyft and Uber, the impact of Transportation Network Company (TNC) laws on the ridesharing industry and its business model is multifaceted:\\n\\n**Initial Phase:**  When ridesharing platforms emerged (around 2012), existing laws didn't directly address their business model.  Pre-existing regulations were often applied in ways that limited driver relationships and inhibited marketplace growth (Lyft 10-K).\\n\\n**Subsequent Regulation:** A significant majority of U.S. states have since enacted TNC-specific laws to address the unique challenges of the industry (Lyft 10-K).  These laws are constantly evolving, being interpreted, amended, and implemented (Lyft & Uber 10-Ks).  This creates a complex and sometimes conflicting regulatory environment across different jurisdictions (Uber 10-K).\\n\\n**Specific Regulatory Requirements:** TNC regulations generally focus on areas such as:\\n\\n* **Background checks:**  For drivers.\\n* **Vehicle inspections:** Ensuring vehicle safety and compliance.\\n* **Accessible vehicles:**  Meeting accessibility requirements for passengers with disabilities.\\n* **Driver and consumer safety:** Implementing safety measures and protocols.\\n* **Insurance:**  Maintaining adequate insurance coverage.\\n* **Driver training:**  Providing training to drivers.\\n* **Driver conduct:**  Establishing standards of conduct for drivers.\\n\\n**Challenges and Uncertainties:**\\n\\n* **Conflicting regulations:**  The fragmented regulatory landscape across different jurisdictions presents significant operational complexities (Uber 10-K).\\n* **Bans and restrictions:** Some jurisdictions have even banned certain ridesharing products or imposed extensive operational restrictions (Uber 10-K, citing specific countries).\\n* **Permitting and fees:**  Companies must obtain permits, pay fees, and comply with reporting requirements in various jurisdictions, facing potential rejection of applications, permit revocation, or increased fees (Lyft 10-K).\\n* **Ongoing evolution:** The continuous evolution of laws and regulations creates uncertainty and necessitates ongoing adaptation by companies.\\n\\n\\nIn summary, TNC laws have moved from a period of regulatory ambiguity to a situation of complex and evolving regulations. While these laws aim to address safety and other concerns, they also create significant operational challenges and uncertainties for ridesharing companies.  The impact is a need for ongoing compliance efforts and adaptation to a constantly shifting regulatory landscape.\\n\", additional_kwargs={}, response_metadata={'prompt_feedback': {'block_reason': 0, 'safety_ratings': []}, 'finish_reason': 'STOP', 'safety_ratings': []}, id='run-4e35872b-a40b-4cce-a914-71d74a0251ee-0', usage_metadata={'input_tokens': 1873, 'output_tokens': 493, 'total_tokens': 2366, 'input_token_details': {'cache_read': 0}}), 'context': [Document(metadata={'id': '1', 'source': 'gs://10k-docs/lyft.pdf', 'company': 'lyft', 'type': '10-K', 'year': '2023', 'url': 'https://d18rn0p25nwr6d.cloudfront.net/CIK-0001759509/d576a7f4-780c-4f39-86a6-aa54b03fa2ec.pdf', 'previous_segments': [], 'next_segments': [], 'relevance_score': 0.7484399080276489}, page_content='# Our business is subject to a wide range of laws and regulations, many of which are evolving, and failure to comply with such laws and regulations could harm our business, financial condition and results of operations.\\n\\nThe ridesharing industry, Light Vehicle sharing industry and our business model are relatively nascent and rapidly evolving. When we introduced a peer-to-peer ridesharing marketplace in 2012, the laws and regulations in place at the time did not directly address our offerings. Laws and regulations that were in existence at that time, and some that have since been adopted, were often applied to our industry and our business in a manner that limited our relationships with drivers or otherwise inhibited the growth of our ridesharing marketplace. We have been proactively working with federal, state and local governments and regulatory bodies to ensure that our ridesharing marketplace and other offerings are available broadly in the United States and Canada. In part due to our efforts, a large majority of U.S. states have adopted laws related to TNCs to address the unique issues of the ridesharing industry. New laws and regulations and changes to existing laws and regulations continue to be adopted, implemented and interpreted in response to our industry and related technologies.

Our platform, and in particular our Mobility products, are subject to differing, and sometimes conflicting, laws, rules, and regulations in the numerous jurisdictions in which we operate. A large number of proposals are before various national, regional, and local legislative bodies and regulatory entities, both within the United States and in foreign jurisdictions, regarding issues related to our business model. In the United States, many state and local laws, rules, and regulations impose legal restrictions and other requirements on operating our Mobility products, including licensing, insurance, screening, and background check requirements. Outside of the United States, certain jurisdictions have adopted similar laws, rules, and regulations while other jurisdictions have not adopted any laws, rules, and regulations which govern our Mobility business. Further, certain jurisdictions, including Argentina, Germany, Italy, Japan, South Korea, and Spain, six countries that we have identified as expansion markets, have adopted laws, rules, and regulations banning certain ridesharing products or imposing extensive operational restrictions. This uncertainty and fragmented regulatory environment creates significant complexities for our business and operating model. In addition, our Delivery and Freight products are also subject to laws, regulations and standards that govern the transportation of food, alcohol and other goods. Substantially all states in the United States and numerous municipalities in the United States and around the world have adopted Transportation Network Company (\"TNC\") regulations. These regulations generally focus on companies that operate websites or mobile apps that connect individual drivers with their own vehicles to passengers willing to pay to be driven to their destinations. These regulations often require TNCs to comply with rules regarding, among other things, background checks, vehicle inspections, accessible vehicles, driver and consumer safety, insurance, driver training, driver conduct, and other similar matters.')]}\n",

Competition within our industry for acquisitions of businesses, technologies, and assets is intense. As such, even if we are able to identify a target for acquisition, we may not be able to complete the acquisition on commercially reasonable terms, we may not be able to receive approval from the applicable competition authorities, or such target may be acquired by another company, including one of our competitors. Further, negotiations for potential acquisitions or other transactions may result in the diversion of our management's time and significant out-of-pocket costs. We may expend significant cash or incur substantial debt to finance such acquisitions, and such indebtedness may restrict our business or require the use of available cash to make interest and principal payments. In addition, we may finance or otherwise complete acquisitions by issuing equity or convertible debt securities, which may result in dilution to our stockholders, or if such convertible debt securities are not converted, significant cash outlays. If we fail to evaluate and execute acquisitions or other strategic transactions successfully or fail to successfully address any of these risks, our business, financial condition, and operating results may be harmed. In addition, any businesses we acquire may not perform as well as we expect. Failure to manage and successfully integrate acquired businesses and technologies, including managing internal controls and any privacy, data security or Al risks associated with such acquisitions, may harm our operating results and expansion prospects. For example, Careem has historically shared certain user data with certain government authorities, which conflicts with our global policies regarding data use, sharing, and ownership. We have maintained our data use, sharing, and ownership practices for both our business and Careem's business, and doing so may cause our relationships with government authorities in certain jurisdictions to suffer, and may result in such government authorities assessing fines or penalties against us. The process of integrating an acquired company, business, or technology or acquired personnel into our company is subject to various risks and challenges, including: diverting management time and focus from operating our business to acquisition integration; disrupting our ongoing business operations; platform user acceptance of the acquired company's offerings; implementing or remediating the controls, procedures, and policies of the acquired company; integrating the acquired business onto our systems and ensuring the acquired business meets our financial reporting requirements and timelines;\")]}\n",

The EU adopted the GDPR in 2016, and it became effective in May 2018. The GDPR applies extraterritorially and imposes stringent requirements for controllers and processors of personal data. Such requirements include higher consent standards to process personal data, robust disclosures regarding the use of personal data, strengthened individual data rights, data breach requirements, limitations on data retention, strengthened requirements for special categories of personal data and pseudonymised (i.e., key-coded) data, and additional obligations for contracting with service providers that may process personal data. In addition, the GDPR contains a provision that individuals shall have the right not to be subject to a decision based solely on automated processing, including profiling, which produces legal effects concerning them or similarly significantly affects them. Decisions by us based on AI or automated processing of data, or insufficient disclosures regarding this processing, have and could impair our business and have and could subject us to lawsuits, regulatory investigations or other harm. The GDPR further provides that EU member states may institute additional laws and regulations impacting the processing of personal data, including (i) special categories of personal data (e.g., racial or ethnic origin, political opinions, and religious or philosophical beliefs) and (ii) profiling of individuals and automated individual decision-making. Such additional laws and regulations could limit our ability to use and share personal or other data, thereby increasing our costs and harming our business and financial condition. Non-compliance with the GDPR (including any non-compliance by any acquired business) is subject to significant penalties, including fines of up to the greater of €20 million or 4% of total worldwide revenue, and injunctions against the processing of personal data. Other jurisdictions outside the EU are similarly introducing or enhancing privacy and data security laws, rules, and regulations, including for automated processing, decision making, and profiling, which will increase our compliance costs and the risks associated with non-compliance. For example, the California Consumer Privacy Act (\"CCPA\"), which provided new privacy rights for consumers and new operational requirements for businesses, went into effect in January 2020.

      "What are the main financial duties, like interest and fees, of the Revolving Credit Facility and their impact on liquidity and capital needs?\n",
      "{'response': AIMessage(content=\"Based on the provided Lyft (2023 10-K) and Uber (2023 10-K) filings, here's a summary of the main financial duties and impacts of their revolving credit facilities:\\n\\n**Lyft:**\\n\\n* **Interest:**  Interest on loans is variable, based on either the Adjusted Term SOFR Rate plus a variable rate tied to the company's total leverage ratio (ranging from 1.50% to 2.25%), or a rate based on the prime rate, federal funds rate, or SOFR, plus a variable rate based on leverage (ranging from 0.05% to 1.25%).  The choice of interest rate calculation is at Lyft's option.\\n* **Commitment Fee:** Lyft pays an annual commitment fee on the undrawn portion of the facility, ranging from 0.225% to 0.375%, depending on its total leverage ratio.\\n* **Covenants:**  The agreement includes covenants restricting Lyft's ability to incur additional debt, create liens, merge, make certain dispositions, pay dividends, engage in transactions with affiliates, and make certain investments and acquisitions.  It also mandates maintaining a minimum liquidity amount ($1.5 billion through June 30, 2024, then subject to change based on leverage ratios and acquisitions), a maximum total leverage ratio (initially 3.50:1.00, then potentially 3.00:1.00), and a minimum fixed charge coverage ratio (1.25:1.00).  Breaching these covenants could lead to the full or partial principal balance becoming due.\\n* **Impact on Liquidity and Capital Needs:** The covenants directly impact Lyft's liquidity and capital needs by setting minimum liquidity requirements and restricting actions that could strain its financial position.  Meeting these covenants is crucial for maintaining access to the credit facility.\\n\\n**Uber:**\\n\\n* **Interest:** Uber's interest expense from long-term debt (which includes the revolving credit facility) totaled $595 million in 2023, comprised of contractual interest coupon and amortization of debt discount and issuance costs.  Specific interest rates for the revolving credit facility are not explicitly detailed in this excerpt, but the provided table shows the total interest expense.\\n* **Covenants:** The agreement includes customary covenants restricting Uber's and its subsidiaries' ability to incur debt, incur liens, and undergo certain fundamental changes, as well as maintaining a specified liquidity level.  The agreement also contains restrictions on dividend payments.  The minimum liquidity covenant was reduced from $1.5 billion to $1.0 billion in an amendment.\\n* **Impact on Liquidity and Capital Needs:** Similar to Lyft, the covenants influence Uber's liquidity and capital needs.  The reduction in the minimum liquidity covenant suggests a change in their capital needs and risk assessment.  The fact that there was no outstanding balance on the facility at the end of 2023 indicates that they did not need to draw on it.\\n\\n**Comparison:** Both companies utilize revolving credit facilities with variable interest rates and covenants designed to manage their liquidity and capital structure.  While specific interest rate details differ in the provided excerpts, both facilities include restrictions on debt, dividends, and other financial actions.  The provided Uber excerpt shows the total interest expense, while the Lyft excerpt details the interest rate calculation methodology.  Both companies had no outstanding balance on their primary revolving credit facilities at the end of 2023.

      "What factors influence deferred tax assets, given tax uncertainties and insurance reserves?\n",
      "{'response': AIMessage(content='Several factors influence deferred tax assets, particularly given tax uncertainties and insurance reserves.  Based on the provided 10-K excerpts from Uber and Lyft, these factors include:\\n\\n**1.  Valuation of Intangible Assets (Uber):**  The establishment of deferred tax assets from intra-entity transfers of intangible assets relies heavily on estimations.  These estimations involve internal revenue and expense forecasts, the intangible assets\\' estimated life, comparable transaction values, and discount rates derived from a weighted-average cost of capital analysis.  The inherent uncertainty in these estimations directly impacts the value of the deferred tax asset.\\n\\n**2. Uncertainty in Tax Positions (Uber):**  Both companies acknowledge the inherent uncertainty in evaluating uncertain tax positions and determining the provision for income taxes.  This involves judgments, assumptions, and estimates.  The possibility of adverse outcomes from IRS and other tax authority examinations further contributes to this uncertainty.  Uber explicitly states that a valuation allowance is recorded against net deferred tax assets because it\\'s not \"more-likely-than-not\" that they will be fully realizable.\\n\\n**3.  Net Operating Losses (NOLs) and Their Carryforwards (Lyft):** Lyft\\'s significant net operating loss carryforwards (NOLs) are a major component of its deferred tax assets.  However, the utilization of these NOLs is subject to limitations, including ownership change limitations under IRC Section 382 and similar state provisions.  The expiration dates of these NOLs also introduce uncertainty regarding their future realization.  The length of time until expiration (Lyft mentions expirations beginning in 2034 and continuing through 2037 for federal NOLs) significantly impacts the value of the deferred tax asset.\\n\\n**4.  Insurance Reserves and Accruals (Lyft):**  Lyft\\'s deferred tax assets include a component related to insurance reserves and accruals.  The ultimate cost of these reserves is uncertain, which in turn affects the related deferred tax asset.\\n\\n**5.  Future Profitability (Uber):** Uber\\'s ability to realize its deferred tax assets depends on its future profitability.  Factors such as market conditions and the successful execution of business plans and tax planning strategies will influence whether these assets can be utilized.\\n\\n**6.  Tax Audits and Assessments (Uber):**  Both companies are subject to ongoing tax audits, and the potential for assessments against them introduces further uncertainty into the valuation of deferred tax assets.  The outcome of these audits could significantly impact the provision for income taxes and the effective tax rate.\\n\\n\\nIn summary, the valuation of deferred tax assets is significantly influenced by the inherent uncertainties in estimating future taxable income, the timing of tax benefits, the outcome of tax audits, and the limitations on utilizing NOL carryforwards.  The presence of insurance reserves and accruals adds another layer of uncertainty.\\n', additional_kwargs={}, response_metadata={'prompt_feedback': {'block_reason': 0, 'safety_ratings': []}, 'finish_reason': 'STOP', 'safety_ratings': []}, id='run-710d865c-b0b5-4d05-9102-549b5ebd6be3-0', usage_metadata={'input_tokens': 2498, 'output_tokens': 586, 'total_tokens': 3084, 'input_token_details': {'cache_read': 0}}), 'context': [Document(metadata={'id': '2', 'source': 'gs://10k-docs/uber.pdf', 'year': '2023', 'type': '10-K', 'company': 'Uber', 'url': 'https://d18rn0p25nwr6d.cloudfront.net/CIK-0001543151/6fabd79a-baa9-4b08-84fe-deab4ef8415f.pdf', 'previous_segments': [], 'next_segments': [], 'relevance_score': 0.7220385670661926}, page_content=\"# Income Taxes\\n\\nWe are subject to income taxes in the United States and foreign jurisdictions. We account for income taxes using the asset and liability method. The establishment of deferred tax assets from intra-entity transfers of intangible assets requires management to make significant estimates and assumptions to determine the fair value of such intangible assets. Significant estimates in valuing intangible assets may include, but are not necessarily limited to, internal revenue and expense forecasts, the estimated life of the intangible assets, comparable transaction values, and/or discount rates. The discount rates used to discount expected future cash flows to present value are derived from a weighted-average cost of capital analysis and are adjusted to reflect the inherent risks related to the cash flow. Although we believe the assumptions and estimates we have made are reasonable and appropriate, they are based, in part, on historical experience, internal and external comparable data and are inherently uncertain. Unanticipated events and circumstances may occur that could affect either the accuracy or validity of such assumptions, estimates or actual results. We account for uncertainty in tax positions by recognizing a tax benefit from uncertain tax positions when it is more-likely-than-not that the position will be sustained upon examination. Evaluating our uncertain tax positions and determining our provision for income taxes are inherently uncertain and require making judgments, assumptions, and estimates. While we believe we have adequately reserved for our uncertain tax positions, no assurance can be given that the final tax outcome of these matters will not be different. We adjust these reserves in light of changing facts and circumstances, such as the closing of a tax audit. To the extent that the final tax outcome of these matters is different than the amounts recorded, such differences may impact the provision for income taxes and the effective tax rate in the period in which such determination is made. The provision for income taxes includes the impact of reserve provisions and changes to reserves as well as the related net interest and penalties. In addition, we are subject to the continuous examination of our income tax returns by the IRS and other tax authorities which may assert assessments against us. We regularly assess the likelihood of adverse outcomes resulting from these examinations and assessments to determine the adequacy of our provision for income taxes. Based on available evidence, management believes it is not more-likely-than-not that the net U.S., Netherlands, and other non-material jurisdictions' deferred tax assets will be fully realizable. In these jurisdictions, we have recorded a valuation allowance against net deferred tax assets. We regularly review the deferred tax assets for recoverability based on historical taxable income, projected future taxable income, excess tax benefits related to stock-based compensation, the expected timing of the reversals of existing taxable temporary differences and tax planning strategies by jurisdiction. Our judgment regarding future profitability may change due to many factors, including future market conditions and the ability to successfully execute our business plans and/or tax planning strategies.\"), Document(metadata={'id': '1', 'source': 'gs://10k-docs/lyft.pdf', 'company': 'lyft', 'type': '10-K', 'year': '2023', 'url': 'https://d18rn0p25nwr6d.cloudfront.net/CIK-0001759509/d576a7f4-780c-4f39-86a6-aa54b03fa2ec.pdf', 'previous_segments': [], 'next_segments': [], 'relevance_score': 0.666700005531311}, page_content=\"# 12.

The state net operating loss carryovers will begin to expire in 2024 and will continue to expire at various times depending upon individual state carryforward rules. Utilization of the net operating loss carryforwards are subject to various limitations including the ownership change limitations provided by Internal Revenue Code (IRC) Section 382 and similar state provisions. The Company is subject to taxation in the United States and various foreign jurisdictions. All net operating losses generated to date are subject to adjustment for U.S. federal and state income tax purposes.

Subsequently, we recognize through the consolidated statements of operations, and as an adjustment to the investment balance, our proportionate share of the investee entities' net income or loss, and the amortization of basis differences. In accounting for these investments, we record our share of the entities' net income or loss one quarter in arrears. Equity method investments for which the fair value option is elected are measured at fair value on a recurring basis with changes in fair value reflected in earnings. We review our equity method investments for impairment whenever events or changes in business circumstances indicate that the carrying value of the investment may not be fully recoverable. Qualitative and quantitative factors considered as indicators of a potential impairment include financial results and operating trends of the investees, implied values in transactions of the investee's securities, severity and length of decline in value, and our intention for holding the investment, among other factors. If an impairment is determined to be other-than-temporary, the fair value of the impaired investment would have to be determined and an impairment charge recorded for the difference between the fair value and the carrying value of the investment. The fair value determination, particularly for investments in privately held companies, requires significant judgment to determine appropriate estimates and assumptions.

The two-class method determines net loss per common share for each class of common stock and participating securities according to dividends declared or accumulated and participation rights in undistributed earnings. The two-class method requires income available to common stockholders for the period to be allocated between common stock and participating securities based upon their respective rights to receive dividends as if all income for the period had been distributed. The Company had no participating securities outstanding during any of the periods presented. Basic net loss per share is computed by dividing the net loss by the weighted-average number of shares of common stock outstanding during the period. The diluted net loss per share is computed by giving effect to all potentially dilutive securities outstanding for the period. For periods in which the Company reports net losses, diluted net loss per common share attributable to common stockholders is the same as basic net loss per common share attributable to common stockholders, because potentially dilutive common shares are not assumed to have been issued if their effect is anti-dilutive. 92\\n\\n# Variable Interest Entities\\n\\nIn accordance with Accounting Standards Codification Topic 810, Consolidation (\"ASC 810\"), the Company evaluates its ownership, contractual and other interests in entities to assess whether it has a variable interest in entities in which it has a financial relationship and, if so, whether or not those entities are variable interest entities (\"VIEs\"). These evaluations are complex, involving judgment and the use of estimates and assumptions based on available historical and prospective information, among other factors. For an entity to qualify as a VIE, ASC 810 requires the Company to determine if the Company is the primary beneficiary of the VIE, and, if so, to consolidate such entity into its consolidated financial statements. The Company consolidates VIEs in which it has a controlling financial interest and is therefore deemed the primary beneficiary. A controlling financial interest will have both of the following characteristics: (a) the power to direct the VIE activities that most significantly impact economic performance; and (b) the obligation to absorb the VIE losses and the right to receive benefits that are significant to the VIE. Periodically, the Company reevaluates its ownership, contractual and other interests in entities to determine whether any changes in its interest or relationship with an entity impacts the determination of whether it is still the primary beneficiary of such entity. The Company has determined that it was the primary beneficiary of one VIE as of December 31, 2023.\\n\\n# Recent Accounting Pronouncements')]}\n",

Credit loss assessment for these securities involves a two-step process:\\n\\n1. **Impairment Determination:**  The companies first determine if an impairment exists.  This occurs when the fair value of the security falls below its amortized cost.  If the company intends to sell or is more likely than not required to sell the security before recovering its amortized cost, the entire difference is recognized as a loss.

Investments in debt securities include commercial paper, certificates of deposit, corporate bonds and U.S. government securities. Investments in debt securities are classified as available-for-sale and are recorded at fair value. The Company considers an available-for-sale debt security to be impaired if the fair value of the investment is less than its amortized cost basis. The entire difference between the amortized cost basis and the fair value of the Company's available-for-sale debt securities is recognized on the consolidated statements of operations as an impairment if, (i) the fair value of the security is below its amortized cost and (ii) the Company intends to sell or is more likely than not required to sell the security before recovery of its amortized cost basis. If neither criterion is met, the Company evaluates whether the decline in fair value is due to credit losses or other factors. In making this assessment, the Company considers the extent to which the security's fair value is less than amortized cost, changes to the rating of the security by third-party rating agencies, and adverse conditions specific to the security, among other factors. If the Company's assessment indicates that a credit loss exists, the credit loss is measured based on the Company's best estimate of the cash flows expected to be collected. When developing its estimate of cash flows expected to be collected, the Company considers all available information relevant to the collectability of the security, including past events, current conditions, and reasonable and supportable forecasts. Credit loss impairments are recognized through an allowance for credit losses adjustment to the amortized cost basis of the debt securities on the balance sheet with an offsetting credit loss expense on the consolidated statements of operations. Impairments related to factors other than credit losses are recognized as an adjustment to the amortized cost basis of the security and an offsetting amount in accumulated other comprehensive income (loss), net of tax. As of December 31, 2023, the Company had not recorded any credit impairments. The Company determines realized gains or losses on the sale of debt securities on a specific identification method. The Company's investments in debt securities include: 88 (i) Cash and cash equivalents. Cash equivalents include certificates of deposits, commercial paper and corporate bonds that have an original maturity of 90 days or less and are readily convertible to known amounts of cash. (ii) Short-term investments. Short-term investments are comprised of commercial paper, certificates of deposit, and corporate bonds, which mature in twelve months or less.

The factors considered in determining whether a credit loss exists can include the extent to which fair value is less than the amortized cost basis, changes in the credit quality of the underlying loan obligors, credit ratings actions, as well as other factors. To determine the portion of a decline in fair value that is credit-related, we compare the present value of the expected cash flows of the security discounted at the security\\'s effective interest rate to the amortized cost basis of the security.

We evaluate our reporting units when changes in our operating structure occur, and if necessary, reassign goodwill using a relative fair value allocation approach. In testing for goodwill impairment, we first assess qualitative factors to determine whether the existence of events or circumstances leads to a determination that it is more likely than not that the fair value of a reporting unit is less than its carrying amount. If, after assessing the totality of events or circumstances, we determine it is not more likely than not that the fair value of a reporting unit is less than its carrying amount, then additional impairment testing is not required. However, if we conclude otherwise, we proceed to the quantitative assessment. The quantitative assessment compares the estimated fair value of a reporting unit to its book value, including goodwill. If the fair value exceeds book value, goodwill is considered not to be impaired and no additional steps are necessary. However, if the book value of a reporting unit exceeds its fair value, an impairment loss will be recognized in an amount equal to that excess, limited to the total amount of goodwill allocated to that reporting unit.

      "{'response': AIMessage(content=\"Based on the provided 10-K excerpts from Lyft and Uber, several factors can slow efficiencies after an acquisition:\\n\\n**Integration Challenges:** Both Lyft and Uber highlight difficulties in integrating the acquired company's technologies, operations, existing contracts, and personnel.  This includes challenges related to:\\n\\n* **Technology Integration:**  Merging different systems and ensuring compatibility can be complex and time-consuming.\\n* **Operational Integration:** Aligning different operational processes and workflows can lead to inefficiencies and delays.\\n* **Contractual Issues:**  Managing and integrating existing contracts from the acquired company can be challenging.\\n* **Personnel Integration:** Retaining key employees and successfully integrating new employees into the existing workforce can be difficult.  This includes potential issues with employee morale and productivity during the transition.\\n\\n**Financial and Management Resource Diversion:** Both companies mention that the acquisition process itself, including identification, evaluation, and negotiation, diverts management's attention and resources from existing operations.  This can negatively impact the efficiency of the core business.  Furthermore, financing acquisitions through debt or equity can strain resources and potentially restrict future business activities.\\n\\n**Unforeseen Issues and Risks:**  Both documents emphasize the risk of failing to identify problems, liabilities, or shortcomings of the acquired company before or during the integration process.  These could include:\\n\\n* **Intellectual Property Issues:**  Potential conflicts or inadequacies in intellectual property rights.\\n* **Regulatory Compliance:**  Non-compliance with laws and regulations, particularly concerning data privacy, data security, and anti-corruption measures.\\n* **Accounting Practices:** Discrepancies or inconsistencies in accounting practices.\\n* **Employee or User Issues:**  Problems related to employee relations or user acceptance of the acquired company's offerings.\\n\\n**Failure to Realize Synergies:**  Both companies acknowledge the risk that the anticipated benefits or synergies from the acquisition may not materialize as expected. This could be due to integration challenges, unforeseen market changes, or inaccurate initial assessments of the target company's value.\\n\\n**Competition and Market Risks:** Uber specifically mentions the intense competition for suitable acquisition targets, which can drive up costs and make it difficult to secure favorable terms.  The risk of regulatory hurdles or the target being acquired by a competitor is also highlighted.\\n\\n\\nIn summary, post-acquisition inefficiencies stem from a combination of integration complexities, resource allocation issues, unforeseen risks associated with the acquired company, and the failure to achieve expected synergies.

The two-class method determines net loss per common share for each class of common stock and participating securities according to dividends declared or accumulated and participation rights in undistributed earnings. The two-class method requires income available to common stockholders for the period to be allocated between common stock and participating securities based upon their respective rights to receive dividends as if all income for the period had been distributed. The Company had no participating securities outstanding during any of the periods presented. Basic net loss per share is computed by dividing the net loss by the weighted-average number of shares of common stock outstanding during the period. The diluted net loss per share is computed by giving effect to all potentially dilutive securities outstanding for the period. For periods in which the Company reports net losses, diluted net loss per common share attributable to common stockholders is the same as basic net loss per common share attributable to common stockholders, because potentially dilutive common shares are not assumed to have been issued if their effect is anti-dilutive. 92\\n\\n# Variable Interest Entities\\n\\nIn accordance with Accounting Standards Codification Topic 810, Consolidation (\"ASC 810\"), the Company evaluates its ownership, contractual and other interests in entities to assess whether it has a variable interest in entities in which it has a financial relationship and, if so, whether or not those entities are variable interest entities (\"VIEs\"). These evaluations are complex, involving judgment and the use of estimates and assumptions based on available historical and prospective information, among other factors. For an entity to qualify as a VIE, ASC 810 requires the Company to determine if the Company is the primary beneficiary of the VIE, and, if so, to consolidate such entity into its consolidated financial statements. The Company consolidates VIEs in which it has a controlling financial interest and is therefore deemed the primary beneficiary. A controlling financial interest will have both of the following characteristics: (a) the power to direct the VIE activities that most significantly impact economic performance; and (b) the obligation to absorb the VIE losses and the right to receive benefits that are significant to the VIE. Periodically, the Company reevaluates its ownership, contractual and other interests in entities to determine whether any changes in its interest or relationship with an entity impacts the determination of whether it is still the primary beneficiary of such entity.

      "What might be at risk with weak IP protection?\n",
      "{'response': AIMessage(content=\"Based on the provided 10-K excerpts from Lyft and Uber, weak intellectual property (IP) protection poses several risks:\\n\\n**Financial and Competitive Risks:**\\n\\n* **Loss of Competitive Advantage:** Competitors could copy technology, reverse-engineer data, and use proprietary information to create competing solutions, harming market position (Lyft, Uber).  This is especially impactful in rapidly evolving, competitive industries.\\n* **Significant Expenses:**  Protecting and enforcing IP rights can be costly and time-consuming, diverting management attention and potentially impacting profitability (Lyft, Uber). Litigation is a possibility, adding to these costs.\\n* **Impaired Business Operations:**  The resources needed for IP protection and enforcement could negatively affect domestic and international operations (Lyft).\\n* **Reduced Brand Value and Reputation:** Inadequate IP protection could damage brand and reputation, leading to decreased customer valuation of products and services (Uber).\\n* **Inability to Compete Effectively:**  Failure to protect IP could impair the ability to compete effectively (Uber).\\n\\n**Legal and Operational Risks:**\\n\\n* **Unenforceable Agreements:**  License provisions protecting against unauthorized use of technology may be unenforceable in certain jurisdictions (Lyft).  Effective IP protection may not be available or may be limited in foreign countries (Lyft).\\n* **Infringement and Litigation:**  The risk of others claiming IP misappropriation exists, leading to expensive legal battles (Uber).  Even if infringement is detected, successful enforcement is not guaranteed (Uber).  A ruling against the company's IP rights could result in their invalidation (Uber).\\n* **Compromised Trade Secrets:**  Trade secrets could be compromised by third parties or employees, resulting in a loss of competitive advantage (Uber).\\n* **Domain Name and Trademark Infringement:** Competitors could acquire or use similar domain names or trademarks, diminishing the value of the company's own (Uber).\\n* **Increased Risk with International Expansion:**  Expanding internationally increases exposure to unauthorized use and disclosure of proprietary information (Lyft).  The company may not have identical or analogous IP protection in all jurisdictions, risking freedom to operate in certain areas (Lyft).\\n\\n\\nIn summary, weak IP protection exposes both Lyft and Uber to significant financial, legal, and competitive risks, potentially impacting their ability to operate and compete effectively.

Personnel costs are classified based on each employee's classification, lease costs (including impairments of right-of-use assets) are classified in the same expense line item where each lease's rent expense was recognized and impairment of other long-lived assets are recorded within general and administrative expenses.\\n\\n# Foreign Currency\\n\\nThe functional currency of our foreign subsidiaries is the local currency or U.S. dollar depending on the nature of the subsidiaries' activities. Monetary assets and liabilities denominated in currencies other than the functional currency are remeasured to the functional currency at the exchange rate in effect at the end of the period. Gains and losses resulting from remeasurement are recorded in foreign exchange gains (losses), net within other income (expense), net in the consolidated statements of operations. Subsidiary assets and liabilities with non-U.S. dollar functional currencies are translated at the month-end rate, retained earnings and other equity items are translated at historical rates, and revenues and expenses are translated at average exchange rates during the year. Cumulative translation adjustments are recorded within accumulated other comprehensive income (loss), a separate component of total equity (deficit).\"), Document(metadata={'id': '1', 'source': 'gs://10k-docs/lyft.pdf', 'year': '2023', 'type': '10-K', 'company': 'lyft', 'url': 'https://d18rn0p25nwr6d.cloudfront.net/CIK-0001759509/d576a7f4-780c-4f39-86a6-aa54b03fa2ec.pdf', 'previous_segments': [], 'next_segments': [], 'relevance_score': 0.6760826110839844}, page_content='# Reconciliation of Non-GAAP Financial Measures\\n\\nIncludes third-party costs incurred related to our acquisition of PBSC in the second quarter of 2022 and our transaction with Woven Planet in the second quarter of 2021. This also includes adjustments to the contingent consideration related to our acquisition of PBSC in the third quarter of 2022. In the second quarter of 2021, we entered into the Reinsurance Agreement under which a third party reinsured certain legacy auto insurance liabilities. The total impact of the transaction to reinsure certain legacy auto insurance liabilities under the Reinsurance Agreement on our consolidated statement of operations was $20.4 million, with $20.2 million in cost of revenue and $0.2 million in general and administrative expense in the year ended December 31, 2021. In the year ended December 31, 2023, we incurred restructuring charges of $50.9 million of severance and other employee costs and $25.3 million related to right-of-use-asset impairments and other costs related to the restructuring plans announced in April 2023 and November 2022. Restructuring related charges for stock-based compensation of $9.9 million, accelerated depreciation of $1.0 million and payroll tax expense related to stock-based compensation of $0.6 million incurred in the year ended December 31, 2023 are included on their respective line items. Refer to Note 16 \"Restructuring\" to the consolidated financial statements for information regarding the restructuring plan announced in April 2023. In the year ended December 31, 2022, we incurred restructuring charges of $29.2 million of severance and other employee costs and $57.4 million related to lease termination and other restructuring costs. In addition, restructuring-related charges for accelerated depreciation of $23.9 million, stock-based compensation of $9.5 million, and payroll taxes related to stock-based compensation of $0.3 million are included on their respective line items. Refer to Note 16 \"Restructuring\" to the consolidated financial statements for information regarding the restructuring plan announced in November 2022.
