0,What challenges do jurisdictions pose to business operations in the context of regulatory compliance?,"['# PART I\n\n## Government Regulation\n\nWe operate in a particularly complex legal and regulatory environment. Our business is subject to a variety of U.S. federal, state, local and foreign laws, rules, and regulations, including those related to Internet activities, privacy, cybersecurity, data protection, intellectual property, competition, consumer protection, payments, labor and employment, transportation services, transportation network companies, licensing regulations and taxation. These laws and regulations are constantly evolving and may be interpreted, applied, created, or amended, in a manner that could harm our business. Examples of certain laws and regulations we are subject to are described below. For further discussion of risks relating to government regulation, see our risk factors, including the risk factors in the section titled ""Legal and Regulatory Risks Related to Our Business"" in Part I, Item 1A of this Annual Report on Form 10-K. Our platform, and in particular our Mobility products, are subject to differing, and sometimes conflicting, laws, rules, and regulations in the numerous jurisdictions in which we operate. A large number of proposals are before various national, regional, and local legislative bodies and regulatory entities, both within the United States and in foreign jurisdictions, regarding issues related to our business model. In the United States, many state and local laws, rules, and regulations impose legal restrictions and other requirements on operating our Mobility products, including licensing, insurance, screening, and background check requirements. Outside of the United States, certain jurisdictions have adopted similar laws, rules, and regulations while other jurisdictions have not adopted any laws, rules, and regulations which govern our Mobility business. Further, certain jurisdictions, including Argentina, Germany, Italy, Japan, South Korea, and Spain, six countries that we have identified as expansion markets, have adopted laws, rules, and regulations banning certain ridesharing products or imposing extensive operational restrictions. This uncertainty and fragmented regulatory environment creates significant complexities for our business and operating model. In addition, our Delivery and Freight products are also subject to laws, regulations and standards that govern the transportation of food, alcohol and other goods. Substantially all states in the United States and numerous municipalities in the United States and around the world have adopted Transportation Network Company (""TNC"") regulations. These regulations generally focus on companies that operate websites or mobile apps that connect individual drivers with their own vehicles to passengers willing to pay to be driven to their destinations. These regulations often require TNCs to comply with rules regarding, among other things, background checks, vehicle inspections, accessible vehicles, driver and consumer safety, insurance, driver training, driver conduct, and other similar matters.', '# If we are unable to make acquisitions and investments, or successfully integrate them into our business, or if we enter into strategic transactions that do not achieve our objectives, our business, results of operations and financial condition could be adversely affected.\n\nAs part of our business strategy, we will continue to consider a wide array of potential strategic transactions, including acquisitions of businesses, new technologies, services and other assets, joint ventures and strategic investments that complement our business, such as our acquisition of PBSC in May 2022, as well as divestitures, partnerships and other transactions. We have previously acquired and invested in, and we continue to seek to acquire and invest in businesses, technologies, or other assets that we believe could complement or expand our business, including acquisitions of new lines of business and other opportunities that operate in relatively nascent markets. We also may explore investments in new technologies, which we may develop or other parties may develop. The identification, evaluation, and negotiation of potential acquisition or strategic investment transactions may divert the attention of management and entail various expenses, whether or not such transactions are ultimately completed. There can be no assurance that we will be successful in identifying, negotiating, and consummating favorable transaction opportunities. These transactions involve numerous risks, whether or not completed, any of which could harm our business and negatively affect our financial condition and results of operations, including: intense competition for suitable acquisition and investment targets, which could increase transaction costs and adversely affect our ability to consummate deals on favorable or acceptable terms; • failure or material delay in closing a transaction; • transaction-related lawsuits or claims; • our ability to successfully obtain indemnification or representation and warranty insurance; difficulties in integrating the technologies, operations, existing contracts and personnel of an acquired company; • challenges related to entering into new markets or geographies; • difficulties in retaining key employees or business partners of an acquired company; • diversion of financial and management resources from existing operations or alternative acquisition opportunities; • failure to realize the anticipated benefits or synergies of a transaction; failure to identify the problems, liabilities or other shortcomings or challenges of an acquired company or technology, including issues related to intellectual property, regulatory compliance practices, litigation, revenue recognition or other accounting practices, or employee or user issues; • acquired businesses or businesses that we invest in may not have adequate controls, processes, and procedures to ensure compliance with laws and regulations, including with respect to data privacy, data protection, and data security, as well as anti-bribery and anti-corruption laws, export controls, sanctions and industry-specific-regulation; • risks that regulatory bodies may enact new laws or promulgate new regulations that are adverse to an acquired company or business, or the risk that we become subject to new or additional regulatory burdens that affect our business in potentially unanticipated and significantly negative ways; • theft of our trade secrets or confidential information that we share with potential acquisition candidates;']","Based on the provided Uber 10-K report excerpt, jurisdictions pose several challenges to business operations regarding regulatory compliance:

1. **Conflicting and Differing Regulations:** Uber operates in numerous jurisdictions with varying and sometimes conflicting laws and regulations related to its business model (mobility, delivery, freight).  This fragmented regulatory environment creates significant complexities for its operations.

2. **Uncertainty and Evolving Regulations:**  Laws and regulations are constantly evolving, and their interpretation and application can be unpredictable. This uncertainty poses a risk to Uber's business, as new laws or interpretations could negatively impact its operations.

3. **Restrictions on Ridesharing:** Some jurisdictions, including Argentina, Germany, Italy, Japan, South Korea, and Spain, have either banned certain ridesharing products or imposed significant operational restrictions. This limits Uber's expansion and market reach.

4. **Extensive TNC Regulations:**  Substantially all US states and numerous municipalities worldwide have adopted Transportation Network Company (TNC) regulations. These regulations often impose requirements on background checks, vehicle inspections, insurance, driver training, and other aspects of Uber's operations, adding complexity and cost.

5. **Lack of Regulation in Some Jurisdictions:**  The excerpt notes that some jurisdictions have not adopted any laws governing Uber's mobility business, creating a patchwork of regulatory environments that Uber must navigate.

The Lyft 10-K excerpt does not directly address jurisdictional challenges to regulatory compliance in the same detail as the Uber excerpt.  However, it highlights the risk that regulatory bodies may enact new laws or regulations adverse to acquired companies or that new regulatory burdens could negatively impact Lyft's business in unforeseen ways.  This indirectly supports the challenges described in the Uber 10-K.
","Jurisdictions pose challenges to business operations in the context of regulatory compliance by imposing national, state, local, or municipal laws and regulations that can be ambiguous in their application or enforcement. This can lead to regulatory fines and proceedings, and in some cases, businesses may be required to cease operations altogether if they are not compliant with these laws and regulations.",0.2775963730282205,0.9161730714714249,0.99999999995,1.0,0.8
1,What challenges does competition in technology pose for maintaining interoperability of platforms?,"['# We depend on the interoperability of our platform across third-party applications and services that we do not control.\n\nWe have integrations with a variety of productivity, collaboration, travel, data management and security vendors. As our offerings expand and evolve, including to the extent we continue to develop autonomous technology, we may have an increasing number of integrations with other third-party applications, products and services. Third-party applications, products and services are constantly evolving, and we may not be able to maintain or modify our platform to ensure its compatibility with third-party offerings following development changes. In addition, some of our competitors or technology partners may take actions which disrupt the interoperability of our platform with their own products or services, or exert strong business influence on our ability to, and the terms on which we operate and distribute our platform. As our respective products evolve, we expect the types and levels of competition to 35 increase. Should any of our competitors or technology partners modify their products, standards or terms of use in a manner that degrades the functionality or performance of our platform or is otherwise unsatisfactory to us or gives preferential treatment to competitive products or services, our products, platform, business, financial condition and results of operations could be adversely affected. Defects, errors or vulnerabilities in our applications, backend systems or other technology systems and those of third-party technology providers, or system failures and resulting interruptions in our availability or the availability of other systems and providers, could harm our reputation and brand and adversely impact our business, financial condition and results of operations. The software underlying our platform is highly complex and may contain undetected errors or vulnerabilities, some of which may only be discovered after the code has been released. We rely heavily on a software engineering practice known as ""continuous deployment,"" which refers to the frequent release of our software code, sometimes multiple times per day. This practice increases the risk that errors and vulnerabilities are present in the software code underlying our platform. The third-party software that we incorporate into our platform may also be subject to errors or vulnerability. Any errors or vulnerabilities discovered in our code or from third-party software after release could result in negative publicity, a loss of users or loss of revenue and access or other performance issues. Such vulnerabilities could also be exploited by malicious actors and result in exposure of data of users on our platform, or otherwise result in a security breach or incident. We may need to expend significant financial and development resources to analyze, correct, eliminate or work around errors or defects or to address and eliminate vulnerabilities. Any failure to timely and effectively resolve any such errors, defects or vulnerabilities could adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations as well as negatively impact our reputation or brand.', ""# We rely on third parties maintaining open marketplaces to distribute our platform and to provide the software we use in certain of our products and offerings. If such third parties interfere with the distribution of our products or offerings or with our use of such software, our business would be adversely affected.\n\nOur platform relies on third parties maintaining open marketplaces, including the Apple App Store and Google Play, which make applications available for download. We cannot assure you that the marketplaces through which we distribute our platform will maintain their current structures or that such marketplaces will not charge us fees to list our applications for download. For example, Apple Inc. requires that iOS apps obtain users' permission to track their activities across third-party apps and websites. If iOS users do not grant us such permission, our ability to target those users for advertisements and to measure the effectiveness of such advertisements may be adversely affected, which could decrease the effectiveness of our advertising, and increase our costs to acquire and engage users on our platform. We rely upon certain third parties to provide software for our products and offerings, including Google Maps for the mapping function that is critical to the functionality of our platform. We do not believe that an alternative mapping solution exists that can provide the global functionality that we require to offer our platform in all of the markets in which we operate. We do not control all mapping functions employed by our platform or Drivers using our platform, and it is possible that such mapping functions may not be reliable. If such third parties cease to provide access to the third-party software that we and Drivers use, do not provide access to such software on terms that we believe to be attractive or reasonable, or do not provide us with the most current version of such software, we may be required to seek comparable software from other sources, which may be more expensive or inferior, or may not be available at all, any of which would adversely affect our business.\n\n# Our business depends upon the interoperability of our platform across devices, operating systems, and third-party applications that we do not control.\n\nOne of the most important features of our platform is its broad interoperability with a range of devices, operating systems, and third-party applications. Our platform is accessible from the web and from devices running various operating systems such as iOS and Android. We depend on the accessibility of our platform across these third-party operating systems and applications that we do not control. Moreover, third-party services and products are constantly evolving, and we may not be able to modify our platform to assure its compatibility with that of other third parties following development changes. The loss of interoperability, whether due to actions of third parties or otherwise, could adversely affect our business. 29""]","Both Lyft (2023 10-K) and Uber (2023 10-K) highlight challenges to platform interoperability stemming from competition in the technology sector.  The core issue is dependence on third-party applications, services, and operating systems (like iOS and Android) that are outside their direct control.

**Lyft's 10-K** notes that competitors or technology partners could take actions that disrupt interoperability,  potentially degrading platform functionality or performance.  This could be achieved through changes to their products, standards, or terms of use that favor their own offerings.  Furthermore, Lyft's reliance on ""continuous deployment"" increases the risk of undetected errors or vulnerabilities in their software, impacting interoperability and potentially leading to security breaches.

**Uber's 10-K** emphasizes similar concerns.  Their reliance on open marketplaces (like the Apple App Store and Google Play) for distribution and on third-party software (such as Google Maps) creates vulnerabilities.  Changes in these marketplaces' structures, pricing, or the availability of essential third-party software could severely impact Uber's platform functionality and distribution.  The example of Apple's user tracking permission requirements illustrates how third-party policies can directly affect Uber's advertising capabilities and user acquisition costs.  In essence, both companies face risks from the evolving landscape of third-party technologies and the competitive actions of other players in the ecosystem.
","Competition in technology poses challenges for maintaining interoperability of platforms as competitors or technology partners may take actions that disrupt the interoperability of their products or services with our platform. Additionally, these competitors may exert strong business influence on our ability to operate and distribute our platform, making it difficult to ensure compatibility with third-party offerings as they evolve.",0.32703081443859694,0.9061893698659008,0.99999999995,1.0,0.6666666666666666

Risk Factors.\n\nInvesting in our Class A common stock involves a high degree of risk. You should carefully consider the risks and uncertainties described below, together with all of the other information in this Annual Report on Form 10-K, including the section titled ""Management\'s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations"" and our consolidated financial statements and related notes, before making a decision to invest in our Class A common stock. Our business, financial condition, results of operations or prospects could also be harmed by risks and uncertainties not currently known to us or that we currently do not believe are material. If any of the risks actually occur, our business, financial condition, results of operations and prospects could be adversely affected. In that event, the market price of our Class A common stock could decline, and you could lose part or all of your investment. For the purposes of this “Item 1A. Risk Factors” section, riders are passengers who request rides from drivers in our ridesharing marketplace and renters of a shared bike, scooter or automobile.\n\n# Risk Factor Summary\n\nOur business operations are subject to numerous risks, factors and uncertainties, including those outside of our control, that could cause our actual results to be harmed, including risks regarding the following:\n\n# General economic factors\n\n• general macroeconomic conditions; • the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic and responsive measures; • natural disasters, economic downturns, public health crises or political crises;', '# Occurrence of a catastrophic event, including but not limited to disease, a weather event, war, or terrorist attack, could adversely impact our business, financial condition and results of operation.\n\nIn addition, we cannot predict the impact any future pandemic or outbreak of a disease, or a catastrophic event will have on our business partners and third- party vendors, and we may be adversely impacted as a result of the adverse impact our business partners and third-party vendors suffer. For example, concerns over the economic impact of the pandemic caused extreme volatility in financial markets, which adversely impacted our stock price and our ability to access capital markets, and any future pandemics or other catastrophic events may have a similar impact. In addition, the broader consequences of the conflict between Russia and Ukraine, which may include additional international sanctions, embargoes, regional instability, and geopolitical shifts, increased tensions between the United States and countries in which we operate, and the extent of the conflict\'s effect on the global economy, cannot be predicted. Any of these risks could materially affect the value of our assets, which could have an adverse effect on our business, financial condition, operating results, or the trading price of our common stock. The failure of a bank, or other adverse conditions impacting financial institutions at which we maintain balances, could adversely impact our liquidity and financial performance. There can be no assurance that our deposits in excess of the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation limits will be backstopped by the U.S., or that any bank or financial institution with which we do business will be able to obtain needed liquidity from other banks, government institutions or by acquisition in the event of a failure or liquidity crisis. To the extent any of the foregoing or other catastrophic event adversely affects our business and financial results, it may also have the effect of heightening many of the other risks described in this ""Risk Factors"" section. Any of the foregoing factors, or other cascading effects of the pandemic that are not currently foreseeable, could adversely impact our business, financial performance and condition, and results of operations.']","Based on the provided 10-K excerpts, several factors could adversely impact Lyft's and Uber's financial results.  The documents highlight the following:

**Lyft:**

* **General macroeconomic conditions:**  Broad economic downturns could negatively affect ridership and revenue.
* **Impact of pandemics and responsive measures:**  Events like the COVID-19 pandemic and related government responses (e.g., lockdowns) significantly impact ridership and the company's ability to operate.
* **Natural disasters, economic downturns, public health crises, or political crises:** These events can all disrupt operations and reduce demand for ride-sharing services.


**Uber:**

* **Catastrophic events:**  Disease outbreaks, weather events, war, or terrorist attacks could severely disrupt operations and negatively impact financial performance.  The impact on business partners and third-party vendors is also a concern, as their difficulties could cascade to Uber.
* **Future pandemics or outbreaks:** Similar to Lyft, future pandemics pose a significant risk to Uber's business.
* **Geopolitical instability:** The Russia-Ukraine conflict and related global instability, including sanctions and embargoes, create uncertainty and could negatively affect Uber's operations and financial performance.
* **Financial institution failures:**  The failure of a bank or other financial institution where Uber holds funds could impact its liquidity and financial performance.  This risk is heightened during times of broader economic instability.


Both companies' financial results are vulnerable to unforeseen events and broader economic factors beyond their direct control.  The provided excerpts do not offer a complete picture of all potential risks, as they only represent sections of the full 10-K reports.  A more comprehensive risk assessment would require reviewing the complete ""Risk Factors"" sections of both companies' 10-K filings.
","Factors that could adversely impact the financial results of the company include the inability to attract or maintain a sufficient number of Drivers, consumers, merchants, Shippers, and Carriers, competition, and the potential for less profitable offerings in new cities compared to current markets. Additionally, the company may not realize expected operating efficiencies from acquisitions and may continue to incur significant operating losses in various regions.",0.37709697186564706,0.0,0.9999999999,0.0,0.72
3,What role did the Deputy Chief Technology Officer play in the context of cybersecurity at a Fortune 500 company?,"['# ITEM 1C. CYBERSECURITY\n\nSafeguarding our critical networks and the information that platform users share with us is vital to our business. One key way that Uber addresses this need is through its cybersecurity risk management program (""Cybersecurity Program""). Uber\'s Chief Information Security Officer (""CISO"") is responsible for the Cybersecurity Program, which is coordinated and primarily executed by the global organization of engineers focused on risk management using the NIST Framework (Identify, Protect, Detect, Respond, and Recover) and activities such as automation, secure development, and advanced analytics and monitoring. The CISO has served in such role since February 2021 and has more than 20+ years of engineering and/or cybersecurity experience, including previously as CISO and Deputy Chief Technology Officer at a Fortune 500 company. The Cybersecurity Program is also supported by Uber\'s Chief Privacy Officer and Associate General Counsel, Privacy & Cybersecurity (""CPO""), who has served in that role since August 2018. The CPO has three decades of experience as a legal advisor to 45 multinational corporations, including serving as Chief Privacy & Security Counsel for a Fortune 100 technology company prior to her role at Uber. The Cybersecurity Program is supported by other members of Uber\'s senior management team as well, including the Chief Legal Officer, Head of Platform Engineering, and EU Data Protection Officer. Uber\'s Board of Directors oversees the Cybersecurity Program through regular updates. This Cybersecurity Program is a critical component of Uber\'s enterprise risk management program, through which Uber reviews business, cybersecurity, information technology, privacy, legal, and geopolitical risks, among others. The Cybersecurity Program is designed to assess, identify, and manage risks from cybersecurity threats. Key elements of this program include: Oversight and Governance. Uber\'s Board oversees the Cybersecurity Program, and Uber\'s risk profile with respect to cybersecurity matters, through regular reports and reviews. These include presentations by the CISO to the Board and Audit Committee on an alternating quarterly basis, quarterly reports of certain cybersecurity incidents to the Board, and annual reports by the CPO to the Board. The CISO also provides quarterly updates to Uber\'s senior management regarding cybersecurity risks, as well as interim updates during regular meetings with Uber\'s engineering, product and internal audit leadership. The CISO and CPO also jointly chair Uber\'s Privacy and Cybersecurity Council, which provides a venue for cross-functional insight and input into the Cybersecurity Program and our privacy program as they relate to Uber\'s business operations. Internally conducted environment and vulnerability assessments. These include semi-annual assessments performed by Uber\'s security engineering teams. The findings from these assessments are reported to Uber\'s senior management, including the CISO, and the Board or Audit Committee. In addition, our internal audit function periodically conducts additional reviews and assessments, which are reported to the Audit Committee.', '# Governance\n\nOne of the key functions of our board of directors is informed oversight of our risk management process, including risks from cybersecurity threats. Our board of directors has oversight responsibilities for material risk for the company, and our executive officers are responsible for the day-to-day management of the material risks we face. Our board of directors administers its cybersecurity risk oversight function as a whole, as well as through the audit committee. Our Head of Security & Privacy has primary responsibility for assessing and managing our material risks from cybersecurity threats in partnership with our CIO and other business leaders. The Head of Security and Privacy has served in various roles within the cybersecurity field for over 15 years, including security leadership roles in multiple organizations. The Head of Security and Privacy holds an undergraduate degree in information security and forensics and a graduate degree in information assurance and has attained various professional certifications within the field including Certified Information Systems Security Professional and Certified Ethical Hacker certifications. Our Head of Security & Privacy oversees our cybersecurity policies and processes, including those described in “Risk Management and Strategy"" above. The processes and procedures by which our Head of Security & Privacy is informed about and monitors the prevention, detection, mitigation, and remediation of cybersecurity incidents include our incident response process, tracking in our centralized risk repository, and our vulnerability management process. Our Incident Response policy describes and supports the activities we take to prepare for discovery, response, and recovery from cybersecurity incidents, which include processes to determine severity, escalation, and response to incidents, as well as those necessary to comply with potentially applicable legal obligations and mitigate brand and reputational damage. Our Head of Security & Privacy or other business leaders provide quarterly updates to the audit committee regarding our company\'s cybersecurity risks and activities. These updates include any relevant recent cybersecurity incidents and related mitigation and remediation efforts, cybersecurity systems testing, status updates on Security and Privacy team efforts, and the like. Our audit committee provides updates to the board of directors on material cybersecurity risks and activities. Item 2. Properties. Our corporate headquarters are located in San Francisco, California, and consist of approximately 380,000 square feet under lease agreements through May 31, 2030.

In 2020, we rolled out our ""Super App"" view on iOS and Android, which combines our multiple offerings into a single app and is designed to remove friction for our consumers. During November 2021, we launched Uber One in the United States as our single cross-platform membership program that brings together the best of Uber. Uber One members have access to discounts, special pricing, priority service, and exclusive perks across our rides, delivery and grocery offerings. Since then, we have expanded Uber One to approximately 25 countries. Our Eats Pass membership program continues to remain available in select cities as a subscription offering. Our membership programs are designed to make utilizing our suite of products a seamless and rewarding experience for our consumers. We exited 2023 with 19 million members for our Uber One, Eats Pass and Rides Pass membership programs. We are also utilizing our data and scale to offer marketplace-centric advertising to connect merchants and brands with our platform network and unlocking cross-platform advertising formats. During October 2022, we officially launched Uber\'s advertising division and introduced Uber Journey Ads, an engaging way for brands to connect with consumers throughout the entire ride process. We now offer a model that enables brands to partner with Uber on a variety of advertising options on the Uber and Uber Eats apps, and beyond, while connecting with consumers in brand-safe and captivating ways. We also provide comprehensive reporting and analysis, which helps brands fine-tune their understanding of consumers and create more impactful campaigns as they connect with consumers at relevant points throughout their journeys and transactions. During the fourth quarter of 2023, active advertising merchants exceeded 550,000. We believe that our advertising further strengthens the power of our platform and will continue to do so as we onboard more advertisers.', '# Drivers\n\nExpress Drive.

5,What challenges do ridesharing companies face in terms of government regulation?,"['# Our business is subject to a wide range of laws and regulations, many of which are evolving, and failure to comply with such laws and regulations could harm our business, financial condition and results of operations.\n\nRecent financial, political and other events have increased the level of regulatory scrutiny on larger companies, technology companies in general and companies engaged in dealings with independent contractors, such as ridesharing and delivery companies. Regulatory bodies may enact new laws or promulgate new regulations that are adverse to our business, or, due to changes in our operations and structure or partner relationships as a result of changes in the market or otherwise, they may view matters or interpret laws and regulations differently than they have in the past or in a manner adverse to our business. See the risk factor entitled ""Challenges to contractor classification of drivers that use our platform may have adverse business, financial, tax, legal and other consequences to our business."" Such regulatory scrutiny or action may create different or conflicting obligations from one jurisdiction to another, and may have a negative outcome that could adversely affect our business, operations, financial condition, and results of operations. Additionally, we have invested and from time to time we will continue to invest resources in an attempt to influence or challenge legislation and other regulatory matters pertinent to our operations, particularly those related to the ridesharing industry, which may negatively impact the legal and administrative proceedings challenging the classification of drivers on our platform as independent contractors if we are unsuccessful or lead to additional costs and expenses even if we are successful. These activities may not be successful, and any negative outcomes could adversely affect our business, operations, financial condition and results of operations. Our industry is increasingly regulated. We have been subject to intense regulatory pressure from state, provincial and municipal regulatory authorities across the United States and Canada, and a number of them have imposed limitations on ridesharing and bike and scooter sharing, and certain jurisdictions have adopted rules governing minimum driver earnings for ridesharing platforms. Other jurisdictions in which we currently operate or may want to operate have and could continue to consider legislation regulating driver earnings. We could also face similar regulatory restrictions from foreign regulators as we expand operations internationally, particularly in areas where we face competition from local incumbents. In addition, we may face regulations relating to new or developing technologies. For example, the European Commission has proposed the EU Artificial Intelligence Act, which would impose operational and regulatory requirements relating to the use of AI technologies, and other jurisdictions may adopt laws and regulations relating to AI. Adverse changes in laws or regulations at all levels of government or bans on or material limitations to our offerings could adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations.', '# PART I\n\n## Government Regulation\n\nWe operate in a particularly complex legal and regulatory environment. Our business is subject to a variety of U.S. federal, state, local and foreign laws, rules, and regulations, including those related to Internet activities, privacy, cybersecurity, data protection, intellectual property, competition, consumer protection, payments, labor and employment, transportation services, transportation network companies, licensing regulations and taxation. These laws and regulations are constantly evolving and may be interpreted, applied, created, or amended, in a manner that could harm our business. Examples of certain laws and regulations we are subject to are described below. For further discussion of risks relating to government regulation, see our risk factors, including the risk factors in the section titled ""Legal and Regulatory Risks Related to Our Business"" in Part I, Item 1A of this Annual Report on Form 10-K. Our platform, and in particular our Mobility products, are subject to differing, and sometimes conflicting, laws, rules, and regulations in the numerous jurisdictions in which we operate. A large number of proposals are before various national, regional, and local legislative bodies and regulatory entities, both within the United States and in foreign jurisdictions, regarding issues related to our business model. In the United States, many state and local laws, rules, and regulations impose legal restrictions and other requirements on operating our Mobility products, including licensing, insurance, screening, and background check requirements. Outside of the United States, certain jurisdictions have adopted similar laws, rules, and regulations while other jurisdictions have not adopted any laws, rules, and regulations which govern our Mobility business. Further, certain jurisdictions, including Argentina, Germany, Italy, Japan, South Korea, and Spain, six countries that we have identified as expansion markets, have adopted laws, rules, and regulations banning certain ridesharing products or imposing extensive operational restrictions. This uncertainty and fragmented regulatory environment creates significant complexities for our business and operating model. In addition, our Delivery and Freight products are also subject to laws, regulations and standards that govern the transportation of food, alcohol and other goods. Substantially all states in the United States and numerous municipalities in the United States and around the world have adopted Transportation Network Company (""TNC"") regulations. These regulations generally focus on companies that operate websites or mobile apps that connect individual drivers with their own vehicles to passengers willing to pay to be driven to their destinations. These regulations often require TNCs to comply with rules regarding, among other things, background checks, vehicle inspections, accessible vehicles, driver and consumer safety, insurance, driver training, driver conduct, and other similar matters.']","Ridesharing companies like Lyft and Uber face numerous challenges related to government regulation, as evidenced by their 10-K filings.  These challenges can be categorized as follows:

**1. Contractor Classification:**  Both companies highlight the significant risk associated with the classification of their drivers as independent contractors.  Changes in legislation or differing interpretations of existing laws could reclassify drivers as employees, leading to substantial increases in costs related to payroll taxes, benefits, and potential legal liabilities.  (Lyft 10-K, Risk Factors; Uber 10-K,  ""Legal and Regulatory Risks Related to Our Business"").

**2. Varying and Conflicting Jurisdictional Regulations:**  The regulatory landscape for ridesharing is fragmented and inconsistent across different jurisdictions (state, provincial, municipal, and international).  This creates complexities in operations and compliance.  Regulations vary widely regarding licensing, insurance, driver screening, minimum earnings, and operational restrictions. Some jurisdictions even have outright bans or significant limitations on ridesharing services. (Lyft 10-K; Uber 10-K,  ""Legal and Regulatory Risks Related to Our Business"").  Uber specifically mentions several countries (Argentina, Germany, Italy, Japan, South Korea, and Spain) where regulations pose significant challenges.

**3. Evolving Regulations and Increased Scrutiny:**  The regulatory environment is dynamic, with ongoing changes and increased scrutiny of large technology companies and those using independent contractors.  New laws and regulations could be enacted that negatively impact the business model.  This includes potential regulations related to emerging technologies like AI, as noted by Lyft's mention of the proposed EU Artificial Intelligence Act. (Lyft 10-K; Uber 10-K).

**4. Costs of Regulatory Compliance and Influence:**  Both companies acknowledge the significant resources invested in complying with existing regulations and attempting to influence or challenge legislation.  These efforts, even if successful, represent substantial costs and carry the risk of unsuccessful outcomes. (Lyft 10-K).

**5.  Transportation Network Company (TNC) Regulations:** Uber specifically points out the widespread adoption of TNC regulations in the US and globally. These regulations often cover various aspects, including background checks, vehicle inspections, insurance, driver training, and consumer safety, adding to the compliance burden. (Uber 10-K).


In summary, the regulatory environment presents a significant and multifaceted challenge for ridesharing companies, impacting their operational costs, legal liabilities, and overall business model.  The uncertainty inherent in this evolving landscape is a key risk factor for both Lyft and Uber.
","Ridesharing companies face challenges in terms of government regulation due to a complex legal and regulatory environment. They are subject to various U.S. federal, state, local, and foreign laws, including those related to privacy, cybersecurity, data protection, competition, and transportation services. Additionally, many state and local laws impose legal restrictions on operating Mobility products, such as licensing and background check requirements. There is also uncertainty and fragmentation in regulations across different jurisdictions, with some countries banning certain ridesharing products or imposing extensive operational restrictions. This creates significant complexities for their business and operating model.",0.403797477866359,0.9769735449724714,0.99999999995,1.0,0.75
6,What challenges could an 'investment company' face in operations and financial reporting?,"['# Our reported financial results may be adversely affected by changes in accounting principles.\n\nThe accounting for our business is complicated, particularly in the area of revenue recognition, and is subject to change based on the evolution of our business model, interpretations of relevant accounting principles, enforcement of existing or new regulations, and changes in SEC or other agency policies, rules, regulations, and interpretations, of accounting regulations. Changes to our business model and accounting methods could result in changes to our financial statements, including changes in revenue and expenses in any period, or in certain categories of revenue and expenses moving to different periods, may result in materially different financial results, and may require that we change how we process, analyze, and report financial information and our financial reporting controls.\n\n# If we are deemed an investment company under the Investment Company Act, applicable restrictions could have an adverse effect on our business.\n\nThe Investment Company Act contains substantive legal requirements that regulate the manner in which ""investment companies"" are permitted to conduct their business activities. We believe that we have conducted our business in a manner that does not result in being characterized as an ""investment company"" under the Investment Company Act because we are primarily engaged in a non-investment company business. Although a significant portion of our assets constitute investments in non-controlled entities (including in China), referred to elsewhere in this Annual Report on Form 10-K as minority-owned entities, we believe that we are not an investment company as defined by the Investment Company Act. While we intend to conduct our operations such that we will not be deemed an investment company, such a determination would require us to initiate burdensome compliance requirements and comply 42 with restrictions imposed by the Investment Company Act that would limit our activities, including limitations on our capital structure and our ability to transact with affiliates, which would have an adverse effect on our financial condition. To avoid such a determination, we may be required to conduct our business in a manner that does not subject us to the requirements of the Investment Company Act, which could have an adverse effect on our business. For example, we may be required to sell certain of our assets and pay significant taxes upon the sale or transfer of such assets.\n\n# Risks Related to Ownership of Our Common Stock', '# Operating as a public company requires us to incur substantial costs and requires substantial management attention. In addition, certain members of our management team have limited experience managing a public company.\n\nAs a public company, we incur substantial legal, accounting and other expenses that we did not incur as a private company. For example, we are subject to the reporting requirements of the Exchange Act, the applicable requirements of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act, the Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act, the rules and regulations of the SEC and the listing standards 44 of the Nasdaq Stock Market. For example, the Exchange Act requires, among other things, that we file annual, quarterly and current reports with respect to our business, financial condition and results of operations. We are also required to maintain effective disclosure controls and procedures and internal control over financial reporting. Compliance with these rules and regulations has increased and will continue to increase our legal and financial compliance costs, and increase demand on our systems. In addition, as a public company, we may be subject to stockholder activism, which can lead to substantial additional costs, distract management and impact the manner in which we operate our business in ways we cannot currently anticipate. As a result of disclosure of information in filings required of a public company, our business and financial condition will become more visible, which may result in threatened or actual litigation, including by competitors. Furthermore, if any issues in complying with those requirements are identified, we may incur additional costs rectifying those or new issues, and the existence of these issues could adversely affect our reputation or investor perceptions of it. Certain members of our management team have limited experience managing a publicly traded company, interacting with public company investors and complying with the increasingly complex laws pertaining to public companies. Our management team may not successfully or efficiently manage being a public company subject to significant regulatory oversight and reporting obligations under the federal securities laws and the continuous scrutiny of securities analysts and investors. These obligations and constituents require significant attention from our senior management and could divert their attention away from the day-to-day management of our business, which could adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations.']","Based on the provided 10-K excerpts from Uber and Lyft, investment companies face several operational and financial reporting challenges:

**1.  Investment Company Act Compliance:**  Uber's 10-K highlights the risk of being classified as an ""investment company"" under the Investment Company Act. This classification would trigger burdensome compliance requirements, restrictions on business activities (including capital structure and transactions with affiliates), and potentially necessitate asset sales with associated tax implications.  This could significantly impact the company's financial condition and operational flexibility.

**2. Complex Accounting and Reporting:** Uber's 10-K notes the complexity of accounting for its business model, particularly revenue recognition.  Changes in accounting principles, business models, regulations, or SEC policies could materially alter reported financial results and necessitate changes to financial reporting processes and controls. This introduces uncertainty and potential for errors in financial reporting.

**3. Costs and Demands of Public Company Status:** Lyft's 10-K emphasizes the substantial legal, accounting, and other expenses associated with being a public company.  Compliance with the Exchange Act, Sarbanes-Oxley Act, Dodd-Frank Act, SEC regulations, and Nasdaq listing standards increases costs and demands on management's time and resources.  The increased visibility also raises the risk of litigation and shareholder activism, further adding to operational and financial burdens.  Furthermore, the limited experience of some management team members in managing a public company adds to the challenges.

**4.  Management Time Allocation:** Both documents indirectly highlight the challenge of balancing compliance demands with the day-to-day management of the business.  The significant time commitment required for regulatory compliance and investor relations could divert management's attention from core business operations, potentially impacting performance.


In summary, the primary challenges for an investment company stem from regulatory compliance (Investment Company Act), the complexities of financial reporting in a dynamic business environment, and the increased costs and management demands associated with being a publicly traded company.  These factors can significantly impact both operational efficiency and the accuracy and reliability of financial reporting.
","The context discusses that if deemed an investment company under the Investment Company Act, applicable restrictions could have an adverse effect on business operations. It also mentions that being characterized as an investment company would require initiating burdensome compliance requirements and could impact financial reporting and results of operations due to changes in estimates of tax obligations.",0.3288417507481422,0.9030978405285706,0.99999999995,0.6666666666666666,0.6086956521739131
7,What role do unobservable inputs play in fair value assessments vs. observable market inputs?,"['# Fair Value Measurements and Financial Instruments\n\nFair value is defined as the price that would be received to sell an asset or paid to transfer a liability in an orderly transaction between market participants at the measurement date. In accordance with ASC 820, Fair Value Measurement (""ASC 820""), we use the fair value hierarchy, which prioritizes the inputs used to measure fair value. The hierarchy, as defined below, gives the highest priority to unadjusted quoted prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities and the lowest priority to unobservable inputs. The three levels of the fair value hierarchy are set forth below: Level 1 Observable inputs such as quoted prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities. Level 2 Observable inputs other than Level 1 prices such as quoted prices for similar assets or liabilities in active markets, quoted prices in markets that are not active or inputs other than the quoted prices that are observable either directly or indirectly for the full term of the assets or liabilities. Level 3 Unobservable inputs in which there is little or no market data and that are significant to the fair value of the assets or liabilities. 86 Our primary financial instruments include receivables, investments in debt and equity securities, accounts payable, accrued liabilities, long-term debt and warrants. The estimated fair value of marketable debt securities, accounts receivable, accounts payable and accrued liabilities approximates their carrying value due to the short-term maturities of these instruments. Refer to Note 3 - Investments and Fair Value Measurement and Note 8 – Long-Term Debt and Revolving Credit Arrangements for further information.\n\n# Variable Interest Entities\n\nWe evaluate our ownership, contractual, and other interests in entities to determine if we have a variable interest in an entity. These evaluations are complex, involve judgment and the use of estimates and assumptions based on available historical and prospective information, among other factors. If we determine that an entity for which we hold a contractual or ownership interest in is a VIE and that we are the primary beneficiary, we consolidate such entity in the consolidated financial statements. The primary beneficiary of a VIE is the party that meets both of the following criteria: (1) has the power to make decisions that most significantly affect the economic performance of the VIE; and (2) has the obligation to absorb losses or the right to receive benefits that in either case could potentially be significant to the VIE. Periodically, we determine whether any changes in the interest or relationship with the entity impact the determination of whether the entity is still a VIE and whether we are still the primary beneficiary. If we are not deemed to be the primary beneficiary in a VIE, we account for the investment or other variable interests in a VIE in accordance with applicable GAAP. Refer to Note 15 - Variable Interest Entities for further information.', ""# Debt Securities\n\n(iii) Restricted investments. Restricted investments are comprised of debt security investments in commercial paper, certificates of deposit, corporate bonds and U.S. government securities which are held in trust accounts at third-party financial institutions pursuant to certain contracts with insurance providers.\n\n# Non-marketable Equity Securities\n\nThe Company has elected to measure its investments in non-marketable equity securities at cost, with remeasurements to fair value only upon the occurrence of observable transactions for identical or similar investments of the same issuer or impairment. The Company qualitatively assesses whether indicators of impairment exist. Factors considered in this assessment include the investees' financial and liquidity position, access to capital resources, and macroeconomic conditions, among others. If an impairment exists, the Company estimates the fair value of the investment by using the best information available, which may include cash flow projections or other available market data, and recognizes a loss for the amount by which the carrying value exceeds the fair value of the investment on the consolidated statements of operations.\n\n# Concentrations of Credit Risk\n\nThe Company's cash, cash equivalents and short-term investments are potentially subject to concentration of credit risk. Although the Company deposits its cash with multiple financial institutions, the deposits, at times, may exceed federally insured limits. The Company has not experienced any losses on its deposits of cash and cash equivalents. Management believes that the institutions are financially stable and, accordingly, minimal credit risk exists. The Company limits purchases of debt securities to investment-grade securities.\n\n## Fair Value Measurements\n\nThe Company measures assets and liabilities at fair value based on an expected exit price, which represents the amount that would be received on the sale of an asset or paid to transfer a liability in an orderly transaction between market participants. As such, fair value may be based on assumptions that market participants would use in pricing an asset or liability. The authoritative guidance on fair value measurements establishes a consistent framework for measuring fair value on either a recurring or nonrecurring basis, whereby inputs used in valuation techniques, are assigned a hierarchical level. The following are the hierarchical levels of inputs to measure fair value: Level 1 Observable inputs that reflect quoted prices (unadjusted) for identical assets or liabilities in active markets. Level 2 Inputs reflect quoted prices for identical assets or liabilities in markets that are not active; quoted prices for similar assets or liabilities in active markets; inputs other than quoted prices that are observable for the assets or liabilities; or inputs that are derived principally from or corroborated by observable market data by correlation or other means. Level 3 Unobservable inputs reflecting our own assumptions incorporated in valuation techniques used to determine fair value. These assumptions are required to be consistent with market participant assumptions that are reasonably available. The carrying values of the Company's accounts payable and accrued and other liabilities approximate their respective fair values due to the short period of time to payment. 89""]","Both Uber (2023 10-K) and Lyft (2023 10-K) reports describe a three-level fair value hierarchy in accordance with ASC 820.  The key difference lies in the role of unobservable inputs:

* **Level 1 (Highest Priority):** Both companies prioritize quoted prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities.

* **Level 2 (Intermediate Priority):**  Both use observable inputs other than Level 1 prices, such as quoted prices for similar assets or liabilities in active markets, or other observable inputs.

* **Level 3 (Lowest Priority):**  Both acknowledge the use of unobservable inputs when there is little or no market data.  However, the reports emphasize that these inputs must be consistent with market participant assumptions where reasonably available.  This suggests that while unobservable inputs are necessary in certain situations, they are used only when observable data is insufficient and must be justified based on market-consistent assumptions.  The use of Level 3 inputs is considered less reliable than Levels 1 and 2.
","Unobservable inputs, classified as Level 3 inputs, play a significant role in fair value assessments when there is little or no market data available. In contrast, observable market inputs, classified as Level 2, include quoted prices for similar assets or liabilities in active markets and other observable inputs. The distinction highlights that Level 3 inputs are crucial when market data is scarce, while Level 2 inputs are used when market data is available.",0.6180102042035137,0.8211030607112475,0.99999999995,1.0,0.6111111111111112
8,How does ASC 842 affect revenue and cost reporting?,"[""# Lyft, Inc. Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements\n\n## Rental Revenue (ASC 842)\n\nThe Company generates rental revenues primarily from Flexdrive and its network of Light Vehicles. Rental revenues are recognized for rental and rental related activities where an identified asset is transferred to the customer and the customer has the ability to control that asset in accordance with ASC 842. The Company operates a fleet of rental vehicles through its independently managed subsidiary, Flexdrive, comprised of both owned vehicles and vehicles leased from third-party leasing companies. The Company either leases or subleases vehicles to drivers, and as a result, the Company considers itself to be the accounting lessor or sublessor, as applicable, in these arrangements in accordance with ASC 842. Fleet operating costs include monthly fixed lease payments and other vehicle operating or ownership costs, as applicable. For vehicles that are subleased, sublease income and head lease expense for these transactions are recognized on a gross basis on the consolidated financial statements. Drivers who rent vehicles are charged rental fees, which the Company collects from the driver by deducting such amounts from the driver's earnings on the Lyft Platform. 84 The Company owns and operates its Light Vehicles in some cities and operates city-owned Light Vehicles in other cities. Though the specific terms of arrangements with cities vary, the Company earns operations fees from cities or shares revenue generated by the systems with cities. Light Vehicle revenue is accounted for under ASC 842 for single-use rides. A single-use ride allows the user to select a specific Light Vehicle at the time the arrangement is entered into and provides the user the right to control the selected Light Vehicle for the desired term of the arrangement. Due to the short-term nature of the Flexdrive and Light Vehicle transactions, the Company classifies these rentals as operating leases. Revenue generated from single-use ride fees paid by Light Vehicle riders is recognized upon completion of each related ride. Revenue generated from Flexdrive is recognized evenly over the rental period, which is typically seven days or less."", '# Property and Equipment, Net\n\n## Leases\n\nWe account for leases in accordance with Accounting Standards Codification (""ASC"") 842, ""Leases"" (""ASC 842""). We elected the ""package of practical expedients,"" which permits us not to reassess under ASC 842 our prior conclusions about lease identification, lease classification and initial direct costs. We made a policy election not to separate non-lease components from lease components, therefore, we account for lease and non-lease components as a single lease component. We also elected the short-term lease recognition exemption for all leases that qualify. We determine if a contract contains a lease at inception of the arrangement based on whether we have the right to obtain substantially all of the economic benefits from the use of an identified asset and whether we have the right to direct the use of an identified asset in exchange for consideration, which relates to an asset which we do not own. Right of use (""ROU"") assets represent our right to use an underlying asset for the lease term and lease liabilities represent our obligation to make lease payments arising from the lease. ROU assets are recognized as the lease liability, adjusted for lease incentives received. Lease liabilities are recognized at the present value of the future lease payments at the lease commencement date. The interest rate used to determine the present value of the future lease payments is our incremental borrowing rate (“IBR""), because the interest rate implicit in most of our leases is not readily determinable. The IBR is a hypothetical rate based on our understanding of what our credit rating would be to borrow and resulting interest we would pay to borrow an amount equal to the lease payments in a similar economic environment over the lease term on a collateralized basis. Lease payments may be fixed or variable; however, only fixed payments or in-substance fixed payments are included in our lease liability calculation. Variable lease payments may include costs such as common area maintenance, utilities, real estate taxes or other costs. Variable lease payments are recognized in operating expenses in the period in which the obligation for those payments are incurred. Operating leases are included in operating lease ROU assets, operating lease liabilities, current and operating lease liabilities, non-current on our consolidated balance sheets. Finance leases are included in property and equipment, net, accrued and other current liabilities, and other long-term liabilities on our consolidated balance sheets. For operating leases, lease expense is recognized on a straight-line basis in operations over the lease term. For finance leases, lease expense is recognized as depreciation and interest; depreciation on a straight-line basis over the lease term and interest using the effective interest method. Acquisitions']","Based on the provided 10K excerpts, ASC 842's impact on revenue and cost reporting is primarily demonstrated through the leasing of vehicles.

**Lyft:**  ASC 842 dictates how Lyft accounts for its rental revenue from Flexdrive and Light Vehicles.  Revenue recognition depends on the type of arrangement. For single-use Light Vehicle rides, revenue is recognized upon ride completion. For Flexdrive rentals, revenue is recognized evenly over the rental period (typically seven days or less).  Costs, specifically fleet operating costs, include lease payments and other vehicle expenses.  For subleased vehicles, both sublease income and head lease expense are recognized on a gross basis.

**Uber:** The excerpt focuses on Uber's application of ASC 842 to its leases, not directly on revenue.  It mentions that lease and non-lease components are accounted for as a single unit.  Variable lease payments (e.g., utilities, taxes) are recognized in operating expenses when the obligation is incurred.  For operating leases, lease expense is recognized straight-line over the lease term.  For finance leases, expense is recognized as depreciation (straight-line) and interest (effective interest method).  The provided text does not detail how ASC 842 affects Uber's revenue recognition.

**In summary:**  The provided excerpts show that ASC 842 significantly impacts the *timing* of revenue recognition for Lyft's vehicle rentals, depending on the lease terms.  For costs, ASC 842 influences how lease expenses are recognized and categorized (operating vs. finance leases) for both Lyft and Uber, impacting the presentation of expenses on the income statement.  However, a complete picture of ASC 842's effect on revenue reporting requires more information, particularly regarding Uber's revenue streams.  The excerpts primarily illustrate the impact on lease accounting and expense recognition.

We also enter into strategic partnerships, joint development and other similar agreements with third parties where intellectual property arising from such partnerships may be jointly-owned or may be transferred or licensed to the counterparty. Such arrangements may limit our ability to protect, maintain, enforce or commercialize such intellectual property rights, including requiring agreement with or payment to our joint development partners before protecting, maintaining, licensing or initiating enforcement of such intellectual property rights, and may allow such joint development partners to register, maintain, enforce or license such intellectual property rights in a manner that may affect the value of the jointly-owned intellectual property or our ability to compete in the market. 40 We may be required to spend significant resources in order to monitor and protect our intellectual property rights, and some violations may be difficult or impossible to detect. Litigation to protect and enforce our intellectual property rights could be costly, time-consuming and distracting to management and could result in the impairment or loss of portions of our intellectual property.

In addition, we may be required to license additional technology from third parties to develop and market new offerings or platform features, which may not be on commercially reasonable terms or at all and could adversely affect our ability to compete. Our industry has also been subject to attempts to steal intellectual property, including by foreign actors. We, along with others in our industry, have been the target of attempted thefts of our intellectual property and may be subject to such attempts in the future. Although we take measures to protect our property, if we are unable to prevent the theft of our intellectual property or its exploitation, the value of our investments may be undermined and our business, financial condition and results of operations may be negatively impacted."", ""# If we are unable to protect our intellectual property, or if third parties are successful in claiming that we are misappropriating the intellectual property of others, we may incur significant expense and our business may be adversely affected.\n\nOur intellectual property includes the content of our website, mobile applications, registered domain names, software code, firmware, hardware and hardware designs, registered and unregistered trademarks, trademark applications, copyrights, trade secrets, inventions (whether or not patentable), patents, and patent applications.

**1. Limited Ability to Protect and Commercialize IP:**  Both Lyft and Uber mention that joint development agreements may lead to joint ownership of IP or licensing arrangements with counterparties. This can restrict a company's ability to independently protect, enforce, or commercialize the resulting IP.  It may require agreement or payment to partners before taking action, potentially hindering their competitive advantage.  The Lyft excerpt specifically highlights that this could affect the value of jointly-owned IP and their ability to compete.

**2. Increased Costs and Resource Allocation:**  Protecting IP rights, especially in the context of joint development agreements, can be costly and time-consuming.  Both companies acknowledge the potential for significant resource expenditure in monitoring and protecting their IP.  This diversion of resources could negatively impact other aspects of their business.

**3. Litigation Risks:**  Both companies note the possibility of costly and time-consuming litigation to protect their IP.  This includes the risk of facing defenses, counterclaims, and countersuits challenging the validity of their IP rights.  The outcome of such litigation is uncertain and could result in the impairment or loss of IP, further impacting their competitive position.

**4. Competitor Actions:**  The agreements may not prevent competitors from independently developing similar or superior technologies.  Furthermore, competitors might attempt to access and exploit data, compromising trade secrets and other IP rights.  This risk is explicitly mentioned by Lyft.

**5. Difficulty in Detecting and Preventing Infringement:**  Both companies acknowledge the challenges in detecting IP theft, particularly given the potential for reverse engineering or unauthorized copying.  Even if infringement is detected, successful enforcement is not guaranteed, and the process can be expensive and distracting.  Uber highlights the risk of operating in countries with inadequate IP protection.

In summary, joint development agreements introduce complexities in IP ownership and control, potentially increasing costs, diverting resources, and exposing companies to legal challenges.  The resulting limitations on the ability to protect and commercialize IP can significantly impact a company's competitive landscape.  The risk of competitors independently developing similar technologies or exploiting compromised IP further exacerbates these challenges.

10,"What links driver contracts, revenue recognition, and the Lyft Platform?","['# Revenues from Contracts with Customers (ASC 606)\n\nWe generate substantially all our revenue from our ridesharing marketplace that connects drivers and riders. We recognize revenue from fees paid by drivers for use of our Lyft Platform offerings in accordance with ASC 606 as described in Note 2 of the notes to our consolidated financial statements. Drivers enter into terms of service (""ToS"") with us in order to use our Lyft Driver App. We provide a service to drivers to complete a successful transportation service for riders. This service includes on-demand lead generation that assists drivers to find, receive and fulfill on-demand requests from riders seeking transportation services and related collection activities using our Lyft Platform. As a result, our single performance obligation in the transaction is to connect drivers with riders to facilitate the completion of a successful transportation service for riders. We evaluate the presentation of revenue on a gross versus net basis based on whether we act as a principal by controlling the transportation service provided to the rider or whether we act as an agent by arranging for third parties to provide the service to the rider. We facilitate the provision of a transportation service by a driver to a rider (the driver\'s customer) in order for the driver to fulfill their contractual promise to the rider. The driver fulfills their promise to provide a transportation service to their customer through use of the Lyft Platform. While we facilitate setting the price for transportation services, the drivers and riders have the discretion in accepting the transaction price through the platform. We do not control the transportation services being provided to the rider nor do we have inventory risk related to the transportation services. As a result, we act as an agent in facilitating the ability for a driver to provide a transportation service to a rider. We report revenue on a net basis, reflecting the service fees and commissions owed to us from the drivers as revenue, and not the gross amount collected from the rider. We made this determination of not being primarily responsible for the services since we do not promise the transportation services, do not contract with drivers to provide transportation services on our behalf, do not control whether the driver accepts or declines the transportation request via the Lyft Platform, and do not control the provision of transportation services by drivers to riders at any point in time either before, during, or after, the trip.', '# Revenue Recognition\n\nWe recognize revenue when or as we satisfy our obligations. We derive revenue from Drivers\' and Merchants\' use of our platform, on-demand lead generation, and related services, including facilitating payments from end-users. The service enables Drivers and Merchants to seek, receive and fulfill on-demand requests from end-users seeking Mobility or Delivery services (collectively the ""Uber Service""). In certain markets we also generate revenue from end-users. In these markets, we charge end-users a direct fee for use of the platform or in exchange for Mobility or Delivery services. Additionally, we derive revenue from customers\' use of Freight services. We periodically reassess our revenue recognition policies as business models and other factors evolve.\n\n# Mobility and Delivery Agreements\n\nWe primarily enter into Master Services Agreements (""MSA"") with Drivers and Merchants to use the platform. The MSA defines the service fee we charge Drivers and Merchants for each transaction. Upon acceptance of a transaction, Drivers and Merchants agree to perform the services as requested by an end-user. The acceptance of a transaction request combined with the MSA establishes enforceable rights and obligations for each transaction. A contract exists between us and the Drivers and Merchants after the Drivers and Merchants accept a transaction request and the Drivers\' and Merchants\' ability to cancel the transaction lapses. The Uber Service activities are performed to satisfy our sole performance obligation in the transaction, which is to connect Drivers and Merchants with end- users to facilitate the completion of a successful transaction. In markets where we are responsible for Mobility services to end-users, end-users are our customers and our sole performance obligation in the transaction is to provide transportation services to the end-user. In markets where we are responsible for Delivery services to end-users, Merchants and end-users are our customers. In addition to our performance obligation to Merchants, our performance obligation to end-users is to provide delivery services. In certain markets, we charge Mobility and Delivery end-users a fee to use the platform. In these transactions, in addition to performance obligations to Drivers and Merchants, we have a performance obligation to end-users to connect end-users to Drivers and Merchants in the marketplace.']","Lyft's revenue is generated primarily from its ridesharing marketplace connecting drivers and riders.  The Lyft Platform facilitates this connection, and driver contracts (Terms of Service or ToS) govern the use of the platform.  Revenue recognition, in accordance with ASC 606 (as detailed in Note 2 of Lyft's 2023 10-K), is based on Lyft's role as an agent connecting drivers and riders.  Lyft does not control the transportation service itself, therefore revenue is recognized on a net basis, reflecting service fees and commissions from drivers, not the gross amount collected from riders.  The entire process—driver contracts, platform usage, and revenue recognition—is intrinsically linked through the Lyft Platform's role in facilitating the transaction between drivers and riders.
","Driver contracts are linked to revenue recognition through the terms of service (ToS) that drivers enter into to use the Lyft Platform. Revenue is recognized based on the fees paid by drivers for using the Lyft Platform offerings, and this is done in accordance with ASC 606.

11,What regulatory challenges could come with global product launches?,"[""# Our presence outside the United States and our international expansion strategy will subject us to additional costs and risks and our plans may not be successful.\n\nIn addition, international expansion has increased our risks in complying with laws and standards in the U.S. and other jurisdictions, including with respect to customs, anti-corruption, anti-bribery, political activity, export controls and trade and economic sanctions. Continued international expansion, including possible engagement with foreign government entities and organizations as customers for our Light Vehicle offerings, including bike-share products through PBSC, may further increase such compliance risks. We cannot assure you that our employees and agents will not take actions in violation of applicable laws, for which we may be ultimately held responsible. In particular, any violation of applicable anti-corruption, anti-bribery, lobbying, export controls, sanctions and similar laws could result in adverse media coverage, investigations, significant legal fees, loss of export privileges, severe criminal or civil penalties or suspension or debarment from U.S. government contracts, and/or substantial diversion of management's attention, all of which could have an adverse effect on our reputation, brand, business, financial condition and results of operations.\n\n# Risks Related to Regulatory and Legal Factors"", '# PART I\n\n## Government Regulation\n\nWe operate in a particularly complex legal and regulatory environment. Our business is subject to a variety of U.S. federal, state, local and foreign laws, rules, and regulations, including those related to Internet activities, privacy, cybersecurity, data protection, intellectual property, competition, consumer protection, payments, labor and employment, transportation services, transportation network companies, licensing regulations and taxation. These laws and regulations are constantly evolving and may be interpreted, applied, created, or amended, in a manner that could harm our business. Examples of certain laws and regulations we are subject to are described below. For further discussion of risks relating to government regulation, see our risk factors, including the risk factors in the section titled ""Legal and Regulatory Risks Related to Our Business"" in Part I, Item 1A of this Annual Report on Form 10-K. Our platform, and in particular our Mobility products, are subject to differing, and sometimes conflicting, laws, rules, and regulations in the numerous jurisdictions in which we operate. A large number of proposals are before various national, regional, and local legislative bodies and regulatory entities, both within the United States and in foreign jurisdictions, regarding issues related to our business model. In the United States, many state and local laws, rules, and regulations impose legal restrictions and other requirements on operating our Mobility products, including licensing, insurance, screening, and background check requirements. Outside of the United States, certain jurisdictions have adopted similar laws, rules, and regulations while other jurisdictions have not adopted any laws, rules, and regulations which govern our Mobility business. Further, certain jurisdictions, including Argentina, Germany, Italy, Japan, South Korea, and Spain, six countries that we have identified as expansion markets, have adopted laws, rules, and regulations banning certain ridesharing products or imposing extensive operational restrictions. This uncertainty and fragmented regulatory environment creates significant complexities for our business and operating model. In addition, our Delivery and Freight products are also subject to laws, regulations and standards that govern the transportation of food, alcohol and other goods. Substantially all states in the United States and numerous municipalities in the United States and around the world have adopted Transportation Network Company (""TNC"") regulations. These regulations generally focus on companies that operate websites or mobile apps that connect individual drivers with their own vehicles to passengers willing to pay to be driven to their destinations. These regulations often require TNCs to comply with rules regarding, among other things, background checks, vehicle inspections, accessible vehicles, driver and consumer safety, insurance, driver training, driver conduct, and other similar matters.']","Based on the provided 10-K excerpts, global product launches present several regulatory challenges:

**Lyft:**  Lyft's international expansion increases compliance risks related to U.S. and foreign laws concerning customs, anti-corruption, anti-bribery, political activity, export controls, and trade/economic sanctions.  The potential engagement with foreign government entities as customers (e.g., through bike-share products) further amplifies these risks.  Non-compliance could lead to negative media, investigations, legal fees, loss of export privileges, severe penalties, and debarment from U.S. government contracts, ultimately harming reputation, brand, business, financial condition, and operational results.

**Uber:** Uber operates in a complex and evolving legal and regulatory environment encompassing various U.S. federal, state, local, and foreign laws.  These laws cover internet activities, privacy, cybersecurity, data protection, intellectual property, competition, consumer protection, payments, labor and employment, transportation services, and taxation.  The differing and sometimes conflicting regulations across jurisdictions create significant complexities.  Many jurisdictions, including some identified as expansion markets (Argentina, Germany, Italy, Japan, South Korea, and Spain), have either banned certain ridesharing products or imposed significant operational restrictions.  Furthermore, Uber's Delivery and Freight products face additional regulations governing the transportation of goods.  The widespread adoption of Transportation Network Company (TNC) regulations in the U.S. and globally adds another layer of compliance requirements concerning background checks, vehicle inspections, accessibility, safety, insurance, and driver training.  The uncertainty and fragmented nature of this regulatory landscape pose substantial challenges to Uber's business model and operations.

12,What reputational risks come from arbitration clauses under legal review?,"[""# Adverse litigation judgments or settlements resulting from legal proceedings in which we may be involved could expose us to monetary damages or limit our ability to operate our business.\n\nWe have in the past been, are currently, and may in the future become, involved in private actions, collective actions, investigations, and various other legal proceedings by Drivers, consumers, merchants, Shippers, Carriers, employees, commercial partners, competitors or, government agencies, among others. We are subject to litigation relating to various matters including Driver classification, Drivers' tips and taxes, the Americans with Disabilities Act, antitrust, intellectual property infringement, privacy, unfair competition, workplace culture, safety practices, and employment and human resources practices. The results of any such litigation, investigations, and legal proceedings are inherently unpredictable and expensive. Any claims against us, whether meritorious or not, could be time consuming, costly, and harmful to our reputation, and could require significant amounts of management time and corporate resources. If any of these legal proceedings were to be determined adversely to us, or we were to enter into a settlement arrangement, we could be exposed to monetary damages or be forced to change the way in which we operate our business, which could have an adverse effect on our business, financial condition, and operating results. In addition, we regularly include arbitration provisions in our terms of service with end-users. These provisions are intended to streamline the litigation process for all parties involved, as arbitration can in some cases be faster and less costly than litigating disputes in state or federal court. However, arbitration may become more costly for us, or the volume of arbitrations may increase and become burdensome. Further, the use of arbitration provisions may subject us to certain risks to our reputation and brand, as these provisions have been the subject of increasing public scrutiny. To minimize these risks, we have in the past and may in the future 39 voluntarily limit our use of arbitration provisions, or we may be required to do so, in any legal or regulatory proceeding, either of which could increase our litigation costs and exposure in respect of such proceedings. For example, effective May 15, 2018, we ended mandatory arbitration of sexual misconduct claims by platform users and employees. Further, with the potential for conflicting rules regarding the scope and enforceability of arbitration on a state-by-state basis, as well as conflicting rules between state and federal law, some or all of our arbitration provisions could be subject to challenge or may need to be revised to exempt certain categories of protection. If our arbitration agreements were found to be unenforceable, in whole or in part, or specific claims were required to be exempted from arbitration, we could experience an increase in our litigation costs and the time involved in resolving such disputes, and we could face increased exposure to potentially costly lawsuits, each of which could adversely affect our business, financial condition, operating results, and prospects."", '# We are regularly subject to claims, lawsuits, government and regulatory investigations and other proceedings that may adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations.\n\nIn addition, we regularly include arbitration provisions in our Terms of Service with the drivers and riders and other parties on our platform.

The mobility, delivery, and logistics industries are highly competitive, with well-established and low-cost alternatives that have been available for decades, low barriers to entry, low switching costs, and well-capitalized competitors in nearly every major geographic region. To remain competitive in certain markets, we have in the past lowered, and may continue to lower, fares or service fees, and we have in the past offered, and may continue to offer, significant Driver incentives and consumer discounts and promotions. We have incurred significant losses since inception, including in the United States and other major markets. We expect our operating expenses to increase in the foreseeable future, and we may not achieve or maintain profitability. If we are unable to attract or maintain a critical mass of Drivers, consumers, merchants, Shippers, and Carriers, whether as a result of competition or other factors, our platform will become less appealing to platform users. Our business depends on retaining and attracting high-quality personnel, and continued attrition, future attrition, or unsuccessful succession planning could adversely affect our business. Maintaining and enhancing our brand and reputation is critical to our business prospects. We receive significant media coverage, including negative publicity regarding our brand and reputation, and while we have taken significant steps to rehabilitate our brand and reputation, failure to maintain and enhance our brand and reputation will cause our business to suffer. Our historical workplace culture and forward-leaning approach created operational, compliance, and cultural challenges and our efforts to address these challenges may not be successful. If we are unable to optimize our organizational structure or effectively manage our growth, our financial performance and future prospects will be adversely affected. Platform users may engage in, or be subject to, criminal, violent, inappropriate, or dangerous activity that results in major safety incidents, which may harm our ability to attract and retain Drivers, consumers, merchants, Shippers, and Carriers. We are making substantial investments in new offerings and technologies, and may increase such investments in the future. These new ventures are inherently risky, and we may never realize any expected benefits from them. We generate a significant percentage of our Gross Bookings from trips in large metropolitan areas, and these operations may be negatively affected by economic, social, weather, and regulatory conditions, public health concerns or other circumstances. We may fail to offer autonomous vehicle technologies on our platform, fail to offer such technologies on our platform before our competitors, or such technologies may fail to perform as expected, may be inferior to those offered by our competitors, or may be perceived as less safe than those offered by competitors or non-autonomous vehicles.', '# We depend on our key personnel and other highly skilled personnel, and if we fail to attract, retain, motivate or integrate our personnel, our business, financial condition and results of operations could be adversely affected.\n\ncompetitive compensation and benefits packages. Job candidates and existing personnel often consider the value of the equity awards they receive in connection with their employment. The decline in our stock price and our cost reduction initiatives may adversely affect our ability to attract and retain highly qualified personnel, and we may experience increased attrition or we may need to provide additional cash or equity compensation to retain employees. Certain of our employees have received significant proceeds from sales of our equity in private transactions and many of our employees have received and may continue to receive significant proceeds from sales of our equity in the public markets, which may reduce their motivation to continue to work for us. We may need to invest significant amounts of cash and equity to attract and retain new employees and expend significant time and resources to identify, recruit, train and integrate such employees, and we may never realize returns on these investments. If we are unable to effectively manage our hiring needs or successfully integrate new hires, our efficiency, ability to meet forecasts and employee morale, productivity and retention could suffer, which could adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations.']","Based on the provided 10-K excerpts from Uber (2023) and Lyft (2023), here's an analysis of the risks posed by employee classification and competition to business stability:

**Employee Classification:**

* **Uber:**  The Uber 10-K explicitly states that classifying drivers as employees (instead of independent contractors) would ""adversely affect our business, financial condition, operating results, or prospects.""  This highlights a significant risk stemming from potential legal challenges and the substantial increase in operational costs associated with employee benefits, taxes, and other employment-related obligations.

* **Lyft:** The Lyft 10-K doesn't directly address the risk of driver misclassification in the same explicit manner as Uber. However, the document emphasizes the importance of attracting, retaining, and motivating personnel.  The risk of increased compensation costs to retain employees, coupled with the potential for legal challenges related to worker classification, is implicitly present.


**Competition:**

* **Uber:** The Uber 10-K describes the mobility, delivery, and logistics industries as ""highly competitive,"" with low barriers to entry and well-capitalized competitors.  The company acknowledges that to remain competitive, it may need to continue lowering fares or service fees and offering significant incentives, potentially impacting profitability.  Failure to attract or maintain a critical mass of drivers and consumers due to competition is identified as a key risk.

* **Lyft:** While not as explicitly detailed as in Uber's report, Lyft's 10-K implicitly addresses competitive pressures through its discussion of attracting and retaining highly qualified personnel.  The need for competitive compensation and benefits packages, and the potential negative impact of a declining stock price on attracting and retaining talent, directly relate to the competitive landscape.  The document also highlights the risk of increased attrition if the company cannot offer competitive compensation.


**Combined Risks:**

The risks of employee classification and competition are intertwined.  If companies are forced to reclassify workers as employees, their cost structures will significantly increase, reducing their ability to compete on price. This could lead to a loss of market share to competitors who may have lower labor costs or different business models.  The need to offer competitive compensation and benefits packages to attract and retain talent in a competitive market further exacerbates the financial pressure stemming from potential reclassification.  Both companies acknowledge the importance of maintaining a critical mass of drivers and consumers, a challenge directly influenced by both competitive pressures and the potential costs associated with employee classification.
","The risks posed by employee classification include the adverse effect on the business if Drivers are classified as employees, workers, or quasi-employees instead of independent contractors.

14,What else affects tech stock prices?,"[""# The market price of our common stock has been, and may continue to be, volatile or may decline steeply or suddenly regardless of our operating performance, and we may not be able to meet investor or analyst expectations. You may not be able to resell your shares at or above the price you paid and may lose all or part of your investment.\n\nIn addition, price and volume fluctuations in the stock markets have affected and continue to affect many technology companies' stock prices. Often, their stock prices have fluctuated in ways unrelated or disproportionate to the companies' operating performance. In the past, stockholders have filed securities class action litigation following periods of market volatility. For example, beginning in September 2019, several putative class actions were filed in California state and federal courts against us, our directors, certain of our officers, and the underwriters named in our IPO registration statement alleging violations of securities laws in connection with our IPO. Securities litigation could subject us to substantial costs, divert resources and the attention of management from our business, and seriously harm our business. In addition, the occurrence of any of the factors listed above, among others, may cause our stock price to decline significantly, and there can be no assurance that our stock price would recover. As such, you may not be able to sell your shares at or above the price you paid, and you may lose some or all of your investment. 43 Delaware law and provisions in our amended and restated certificate of incorporation and amended and restated bylaws could make a merger, tender offer, or proxy contest difficult, thereby depressing the trading price of our common stock. Our amended and restated certificate of incorporation and amended and restated bylaws contain provisions that could depress the trading price of our common stock by acting to discourage, delay, or prevent a change of control of our company or changes in our management that the stockholders of our company may deem advantageous. These provisions include the following: our board of directors has the right to elect directors to fill vacancies created by the expansion of our board of directors or the resignation, death, or removal of a director, which prevents stockholders from being able to fill vacancies on our board of directors; advance notice requirements for stockholder proposals, which may reduce the number of stockholder proposals available for stockholder consideration; limitations on stockholder ability to convene special stockholder meetings, which could make it difficult for our stockholders to adopt desired governance changes; prohibition on cumulative voting in the election of directors, which limits the ability of minority stockholders to elect director candidates; and our board of directors is able to issue, without stockholder approval, shares of undesignated preferred stock, which makes it possible for our board of directors to issue preferred stock with voting or other rights or preferences that could impede the success of any attempt to acquire us."", ""# The trading price of our Class A common stock may be volatile, and you could lose all or part of your investment.\n\nThe trading price of our Class A common stock may be volatile and could be subject to fluctuations in response to various factors, some of which are beyond our control.

Factors that could cause fluctuations in the trading price of our Class A common stock include the following: • price and volume fluctuations in the overall stock market from time to time, including fluctuations due to general economic uncertainty or negative market sentiment; • volatility in the trading prices and trading volumes of technology stocks generally, or those in our industry, including fluctuations unrelated or disproportionate to the operating performance of those technology companies; • changes in operating performance and stock market valuations of other technology companies generally, or those in our industry in particular; • sales or purchases of shares of our Class A common stock by us, our officers, or our significant stockholders, as well as the perception that such sales or purchases could occur; 49 • issuance of shares of our Class A common stock, whether in connection with our equity incentive plans, an acquisition or upon conversion of some or all of our outstanding 2025 Notes; • failure of securities analysts to maintain coverage of us, changes in financial estimates by securities analysts who follow our company or our failure to meet these estimates or the expectations of investors; • the financial projections or goals we may provide to the public, any changes in those projections or goals or our failure to meet those projections or goals; • announcements by us or our competitors of new offerings or platform features; • investor sentiment and the public's reaction to our press releases, earnings and other public announcements and filings with the SEC, or those of our competitors or others in our industry; • rumors and market speculation involving us or other companies in our industry; short selling of our Class A common stock or related derivative securities; • actual or anticipated changes in our results of operations or fluctuations in our results of operations; • actual or anticipated developments in our business, our competitors' businesses or the competitive landscape generally; • litigation involving us, our industry or both, or investigations by regulators into our operations or those of our competitors; • developments or disputes concerning our intellectual property or other proprietary rights; • announced or completed acquisitions of businesses, services or technologies by us or our competitors; • new laws or regulations or new interpretations of existing laws or regulations applicable to our business or statements by public officials regarding potential new laws or regulations; • changes in accounting standards, policies, guidelines, interpretations or principles; • any significant change in our management or our board of directors; and""]","Based on the provided 10-K excerpts from Uber and Lyft, several factors beyond operating performance affect tech stock prices:

* **Overall Market Volatility:**  Both documents mention that general economic uncertainty, negative market sentiment, and price and volume fluctuations in the overall stock market can significantly impact stock prices, regardless of a company's performance.

* **Technology Sector Volatility:**  The price fluctuations in the technology sector as a whole, often unrelated to individual company performance, are highlighted as a major influence.  This includes changes in the valuations of other tech companies and general investor sentiment towards the tech industry.

* **Company-Specific Events:**  Several factors specific to the companies themselves also influence stock prices. These include:
    * **Analyst Ratings and Expectations:** Failure to meet analyst estimates or investor expectations can lead to price drops. Changes in analyst coverage also affect stock prices.
    * **Public Announcements:** Press releases, earnings announcements, and SEC filings (and those of competitors) influence investor perception and, consequently, stock prices.  Rumors and market speculation also play a role.
    * **Stock Issuance:**  Issuance of additional shares (e.g., through equity incentive plans or acquisitions) can dilute existing shares and affect price.
    * **Acquisitions and New Offerings:** Announcements of acquisitions or new products/features by the company or its competitors can impact stock prices.
    * **Litigation and Regulatory Investigations:** Legal issues and regulatory scrutiny can negatively affect investor confidence and stock prices.
    * **Management Changes:** Significant changes in management or the board of directors can also impact investor sentiment.
    * **Changes in Accounting Standards:**  Changes in accounting practices can affect reported financial results and investor perception.


* **Corporate Governance:**  Uber's excerpt mentions that provisions in its certificate of incorporation and bylaws could make a change of control difficult, potentially depressing the stock price.  This highlights the role of corporate governance structures in influencing market perception and stock valuation.


It's important to note that these are just some of the factors mentioned in the provided excerpts.  A complete analysis would require reviewing the full 10-K reports and potentially other sources of information.

15,What risks do businesses face from changing cross-border data laws?,"['# Our business is subject to extensive government regulation and oversight relating to the provision of payment and financial services.\n\nThis risk is enhanced in certain jurisdictions with stringent privacy laws and, as we expand our products, offerings, and operations domestically and internationally, we have, and may continue to become subject to amended or additional laws that impose substantial additional obligations related to data privacy and security. The EU adopted the GDPR in 2016, and it became effective in May 2018. The GDPR applies extraterritorially and imposes stringent requirements for controllers and processors of personal data. Such requirements include higher consent standards to process personal data, robust disclosures regarding the use of personal data, strengthened individual data rights, data breach requirements, limitations on data retention, strengthened requirements for special categories of personal data and pseudonymised (i.e., key-coded) data, and additional obligations for contracting with service providers that may process personal data. In addition, the GDPR contains a provision that individuals shall have the right not to be subject to a decision based solely on automated processing, including profiling, which produces legal effects concerning them or similarly significantly affects them. Decisions by us based on AI or automated processing of data, or insufficient disclosures regarding this processing, have and could impair our business and have and could subject us to lawsuits, regulatory investigations or other harm. The GDPR further provides that EU member states may institute additional laws and regulations impacting the processing of personal data, including (i) special categories of personal data (e.g., racial or ethnic origin, political opinions, and religious or philosophical beliefs) and (ii) profiling of individuals and automated individual decision-making. Such additional laws and regulations could limit our ability to use and share personal or other data, thereby increasing our costs and harming our business and financial condition. Non-compliance with the GDPR (including any non-compliance by any acquired business) is subject to significant penalties, including fines of up to the greater of €20 million or 4% of total worldwide revenue, and injunctions against the processing of personal data. Other jurisdictions outside the EU are similarly introducing or enhancing privacy and data security laws, rules, and regulations, including for automated processing, decision making, and profiling, which will increase our compliance costs and the risks associated with non-compliance. For example, the California Consumer Privacy Act (""CCPA""), which provided new privacy rights for consumers and new operational requirements for businesses, went into effect in January 2020. The CCPA includes a statutory damages framework and private rights of action against businesses that fail to comply with certain CCPA terms or implement reasonable security procedures and practices to prevent data breaches. Other U.S. states have adopted, and likely will continue to 38', '# Changes in laws or regulations relating to privacy, data protection or the protection or transfer of personal data, or any actual or perceived failure by us to comply with such laws and regulations or any other obligations relating to privacy, data protection or the protection or transfer of personal data, could adversely affect our business.\n\nregulations such as the CCPA and CPRA imposing new and relatively burdensome obligations, and with substantial uncertainty over the interpretation and application of these and other laws and regulations, we may face challenges in addressing their requirements and making necessary changes to our policies and practices, and may incur significant costs and expenses in an effort to do so. In particular, with regard to HIPAA, we may incur increased costs as we perform our obligations to our healthcare customers under our agreements with them. As we consider expansion of business offerings and markets and as laws and regulations change, we expect to incur additional costs related to privacy, data protection and information security standards and protocols imposed by laws, regulations, industry standards or contractual obligations related to such offerings and face additional risks that such expansion could be inconsistent with, or fail or be alleged to fail to meet all requirements of such laws, regulations or obligations. Despite our efforts to comply with applicable laws, regulations and other obligations relating to privacy, data protection and information security, it is possible that our practices, offerings or platform could be inconsistent with, or fail or be alleged to fail to meet all requirements of, such laws, regulations or obligations. Our failure, or the failure by our third-party providers or partners, to comply with applicable laws, regulations or other actual or asserted obligations relating to privacy, data protection or information security, or any compromise of security that results in unauthorized access to, or unauthorized loss, unavailability, corruption, use, release or other processing of personal information or other driver or rider data, or the perception that any of the foregoing types of failure or compromise has occurred, could damage our reputation, discourage new and existing drivers and riders from using our platform or result in fines or proceedings by governmental agencies and private claims and litigation, any of which could adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations. Additionally, the perception of concerns relating to privacy, data protection or information security, whether or not valid, may harm our reputation and brand and adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations.']","Businesses face several risks from changing cross-border data laws, primarily revolving around compliance costs and potential legal repercussions.  Based on the provided 10-K excerpts from Uber and Lyft:

**Key Risks:**

* **Increased Compliance Costs:**  The evolving landscape of data privacy laws, such as the GDPR, CCPA, and CPRA, necessitates significant investments in updating policies, practices, and technology to ensure compliance.  This includes higher consent standards, robust data disclosures, strengthened data security measures, and potentially changes to data processing methods to accommodate restrictions on automated decision-making and profiling.  Both Uber and Lyft highlight the substantial costs associated with meeting these requirements.

* **Non-Compliance Penalties:** Failure to comply with these regulations can result in substantial financial penalties.  The GDPR, for example, imposes fines up to €20 million or 4% of global revenue, while the CCPA includes a statutory damages framework and allows for private lawsuits.  The risk of non-compliance extends to acquired businesses as well, as noted by Uber.

* **Reputational Damage:**  Even if technically compliant, perceived failures to protect user data can severely damage a company's reputation, leading to decreased user trust and potentially impacting business growth.  Both Lyft and Uber mention that the perception of privacy or security concerns, regardless of validity, can negatively affect their business.

* **Legal Actions:**  Non-compliance or data breaches can lead to lawsuits from both governmental agencies and private individuals, resulting in significant legal costs and potential financial liabilities.  Lyft explicitly mentions the risk of fines, proceedings, and private claims resulting from data security failures.

* **Limitations on Data Use:**  Stringent data privacy laws may restrict how companies collect, use, and share personal data, potentially hindering business operations and impacting the development of new products or services that rely on data analysis.  Uber notes that additional laws and regulations could limit their ability to use and share data, increasing costs and harming their business.

* **Uncertainty in Interpretation and Application:**  The evolving nature and sometimes ambiguous interpretation of these laws create uncertainty for businesses, making it challenging to fully comply and potentially leading to unforeseen legal challenges.  Lyft highlights the substantial uncertainty surrounding the interpretation and application of laws like the CCPA and CPRA.


In summary, the changing landscape of cross-border data laws presents a significant challenge for businesses, requiring proactive and ongoing efforts to ensure compliance, manage risks, and mitigate potential negative consequences.  The financial and reputational implications of non-compliance are substantial.
","Businesses face several risks from changing cross-border data laws, including the inability to transfer personal data from the EEA, the United Kingdom, or other jurisdictions, which could adversely affect their business, financial condition, and operating results. This situation may lead to substantial fines, enforcement actions, litigation, injunctive relief, and other costly penalties. Additionally, changes in laws could result in a failure to comply with privacy and data protection policies, potentially leading to proceedings or actions against the business, which could harm its reputation and brand. Furthermore, evolving data protection laws may require changes to data collection, use, transfer, and disclosure practices, increasing compliance costs and adversely affecting operations.",0.6230689911773684,0.9977428423235671,0.99999999995,1.0,
16,What is the purpose of using non-GAAP financial measures in assessing a company's performance?,"['# Reconciliation of Non-GAAP Financial Measures\n\nWe use our non-GAAP financial measures in conjunction with GAAP measures as part of our overall assessment of our performance, including the preparation of our annual operating budget and quarterly forecasts, to evaluate the effectiveness of our business strategies, and to communicate with our board of directors concerning our financial performance. Our definitions may differ from the definitions used by other companies and therefore comparability may be limited. In addition, other companies may not publish these or similar metrics. Furthermore, these measures have certain limitations in that they do not include the impact of certain expenses that are reflected in our consolidated statements of operations that are necessary to run our business. Thus, our non-GAAP financial measures should be considered in addition to, not as substitutes for, or in isolation from, measures prepared in accordance with GAAP. We compensate for these limitations by providing a reconciliation of our non-GAAP financial measures to the most directly comparable GAAP financial measure. We encourage investors and others to review our financial information in its entirety, not to rely on any single financial measure and to view our non-GAAP financial measures in conjunction with the respective most directly comparable GAAP financial measures. 67 Net loss is the most directly comparable financial measure to Adjusted EBITDA. The following table provides a reconciliation of net loss to Adjusted EBITDA (in millions):', ""# 2023 Compared to 2022\n\nAdjusted EBITDA improved $2.3 billion, to $4.1 billion, primarily attributable to a $1.7 billion increase in Mobility Adjusted EBITDA, a $955 million improvement in Delivery Adjusted EBITDA, partially offset by a $216 million increase in Corporate G&A and Platform R&D costs as well as a $64 million decrease in Freight Adjusted EBITDA.\n\n## Reconciliations of Non-GAAP Financial Measures\n\nWe collect and analyze operating and financial data to evaluate the health of our business and assess our performance. In addition to revenue, net income (loss), income (loss) from operations, and other results under GAAP, we use Adjusted EBITDA, revenue growth rates in constant currency and free cash flow, which are described below, to evaluate our business. We use these non-GAAP financial measures for financial and operational decision-making and as a means to evaluate period-to-period comparisons. We believe that these non-GAAP financial measures provide meaningful supplemental information regarding our performance by excluding certain items that may not be indicative of our recurring core business operating results. We believe that both management and investors benefit from referring to these non-GAAP financial measures in assessing our performance and when planning, forecasting, and analyzing future periods. These non-GAAP financial measures also facilitate management's internal comparisons to our historical performance. We believe these non-GAAP financial measures are useful to investors both because (1) they allow for greater transparency with respect to key metrics used by management in its financial and operational decision-making and (2) they are used by our institutional investors and the analyst community to help them analyze the health of our business. Accordingly, we believe that these non-GAAP financial measures provide useful information to investors and others in understanding and evaluating our operating results in the same manner as our management team and board of directors. Our calculation of these non- GAAP financial measures may differ from similarly-titled non-GAAP measures, if any, reported by our peer companies. These non-GAAP financial measures should not be considered in isolation from, or as substitutes for, financial information prepared in accordance with GAAP. 60""]","Based on the provided Lyft and Uber 10-K reports, companies use non-GAAP financial measures for several reasons:

* **Internal Performance Assessment:**  Both Lyft and Uber use non-GAAP measures (like Adjusted EBITDA) alongside GAAP measures to assess their performance, prepare budgets and forecasts, evaluate business strategies, and communicate with their boards of directors.  (Lyft 10-K)

* **Operational Decision-Making:** Uber explicitly states that they use non-GAAP measures (Adjusted EBITDA, revenue growth rates in constant currency, and free cash flow) for financial and operational decision-making and period-to-period comparisons.  (Uber 10-K)

* **Supplemental Information:**  Both companies believe that these non-GAAP measures provide meaningful supplemental information by excluding items that may not reflect recurring core business operating results.  This allows for a clearer view of underlying performance. (Uber 10-K)

* **Investor Communication and Analysis:**  Uber highlights that these measures benefit both management and investors, providing transparency into key metrics used in decision-making.  They also note that institutional investors and analysts use these measures to analyze the business's health. (Uber 10-K)  Lyft similarly encourages investors to review their financial information in its entirety, using non-GAAP measures in conjunction with GAAP measures. (Lyft 10-K)

**Important Note:** Both companies emphasize that non-GAAP measures should not replace GAAP measures and should be considered alongside them.  They also acknowledge that their definitions may differ from those used by other companies, limiting direct comparability.

17,What is the significance of the debt discount in relation to the 2025 Convertible Notes?,"['# 2025 Convertible Notes\n\nUpon conversion of the 2025 Convertible Notes, we will pay or deliver, as the case may be, cash, shares of our common stock or a combination of cash and shares of our common stock, at our election. We may not redeem the notes prior to December 20, 2023. We may redeem for cash all or any portion of the notes, at our option, on or after December 20, 2023 if the last reported sale price of our common stock has been at least 130% of the conversion price then in effect for at least 20 trading days (whether or not consecutive) 107 during any 30 consecutive trading day period (including the last trading day of such period) ending on, and including, the trading day immediately preceding the date on which we provide notice of redemption at a redemption price equal to 100% of the principal amount of the notes to be redeemed, plus accrued and unpaid special interest, if any, to, but excluding, the redemption date. The indenture governing the 2025 Convertible Notes does not contain any financial or operating covenants or restrictions on the payments of dividends, the incurrence of indebtedness or the issuance or repurchase of securities by us or any of our subsidiaries. Prior to the adoption of ASU 2020-06, the proceeds from the issuance of the 2025 Convertible Notes were allocated between the conversion feature recorded as equity and the liability for the notes themselves. The difference of $243 million between the principal amount of the 2025 Convertible Notes and the liability component (the ""debt discount"") was amortized to interest expense using the effective interest method over the term of the 2025 Convertible Notes. The equity component of the 2025 Convertible Notes was included in additional paid-in capital in the consolidated balance sheet as of December 31, 2020 and was not remeasured as it continued to meet the conditions for equity classification. To determine the fair value of the liability component of the 2025 Convertible Notes as of the pricing date, we used the binomial model with inputs of time to maturity, conversion ratio, our stock price, risk free rate and volatility. Effective January 1, 2021, we early adopted ASU 2020-06 using the modified retrospective approach. The adoption of this standard resulted in a decrease to additional paid-in capital of $243 million and an increase to our 2025 Convertible Notes by the same amount. At adoption, there was no adjustment recorded to the opening accumulated deficit. As a result of the adoption, starting on January 1, 2021 interest expense is reduced as a result of accounting for the 2025 Convertible Notes as a single liability measured at its amortized cost. The fair value of our 2025 Convertible Notes was $1.2 billion as of December 31, 2023 and was determined based on quoted prices in markets that are not active, which is considered a Level 2 valuation input.', '# Convertible Senior Notes\n\nHolders of the 2025 Notes who convert their 2025 Notes in connection with certain corporate events that constitute a make-whole fundamental change (as defined in the Indenture) are, under certain circumstances, entitled to an increase in the conversion rate. Additionally in the event of a corporate event constituting a fundamental change (as defined in the Indenture), holders of the 2025 Notes may require the Company to repurchase all or a portion of their 2025 Notes at a repurchase price equal to 100% of the principal amount of the 2025 Notes being repurchased, plus any accrued and unpaid interest to, but excluding, the repurchase date. Prior to the adoption of ASU 2020-06, the Company separated the 2025 Notes into a liability and an equity component. At the date of issuance, the Company determined the fair value of the liability component to be $558.3 million calculated as the present value of future cash flows discounted at the borrowing rate for a similar nonconvertible debt instrument. The equity component representing the conversion option was $189.2 million and was determined by deducting the fair value of the liability component from the par value of the 2025 Notes. The equity component is not remeasured as long as it continues to meet the conditions for equity classification. The difference between the principal amount of the 2025 Notes and the liability component (""debt discount"") was amortized to interest expense over the contractual term at an effective interest rate of 8.0%. Following the adoption of ASU 2020-06 on January 1, 2022, the Company no longer bifurcates the 2025 Notes, but rather accounts for the conversion feature as a single debt instrument. The difference between the carrying amount and face value of the liability results in a reduced liability component. Therefore, less interest expense is being recorded each period from January 1, 2022 to maturity and the equity component is now classified as debt, eliminating the subsequent amortization of the debt discount as interest expense. Accordingly, the Company recorded a net decrease to additional paid-in capital of approximately $140.0 million, net of tax, to remove the equity component separately recorded for the conversion features associated with the 2025 Notes and equity component associated with the issuance costs, an increase of approximately $133.5 million in the carrying value of the 2025 Notes to reflect the full principal amount, net of issuance costs, and an increase to accumulated deficit of approximately $6.5 million, net of tax in the Company\'s consolidated balance sheet with no impact to the Company\'s consolidated statements of operations. Debt issuance costs related to the 2025 Notes totaled $14.3 million at inception and were comprised of discounts and commissions payable to the initial purchasers and third-party offering costs and will be amortized to interest expense using the effective interest method over the contractual term. As of December 31, 2023, the unamortized debt discount and debt issuance cost of the 2025 Notes was 4.0 million on the consolidated balance sheet.']","The debt discount relates to the accounting treatment of convertible notes before and after the adoption of ASU 2020-06.

**Before ASU 2020-06:**  Both Uber and Lyft separated the convertible notes into liability and equity components.  The difference between the principal amount of the notes and the fair value of the liability component was termed the ""debt discount.""  This discount was amortized to interest expense over the life of the notes using the effective interest method.  For Uber, this amounted to $243 million, while for Lyft, it was $189.2 million (the difference between the par value and the fair value of the liability component).

**After ASU 2020-06:** Both companies adopted this accounting standard, resulting in a change in how convertible notes are treated.  The notes are now accounted for as a single liability measured at amortized cost.  This eliminates the separate equity component and the subsequent amortization of the debt discount as interest expense.  The impact was a decrease in additional paid-in capital and an increase in the carrying value of the convertible notes.  For Uber, this resulted in a $243 million decrease to additional paid-in capital and a corresponding increase to the 2025 Convertible Notes. For Lyft, the adoption resulted in a net decrease to additional paid-in capital of approximately $140 million (net of tax), and an increase in the carrying value of the 2025 Notes of approximately $133.5 million (net of issuance costs).  Lyft also saw an increase to its accumulated deficit of approximately $6.5 million (net of tax).

In essence, the significance of the debt discount lies in its impact on interest expense and the classification of the convertible notes on the balance sheet.  The adoption of ASU 2020-06 changed the accounting treatment, leading to a reduction in interest expense and reclassification of the equity component as debt.

18,What is the purpose of claims reserve valuations in the context of insurance liabilities?,"['# Insurance Reserves and Insurance-related Accruals\n\nWe utilize both a wholly-owned captive insurance subsidiary and third-party insurance, which may include deductibles and self-insured retentions, to insure or reinsure costs including auto liability, uninsured and underinsured motorist, auto physical damage, first party injury coverages including personal injury protection under state law and general business liabilities up to certain limits. The recorded liabilities reflect the estimated cost for claims incurred but not paid and claims that have been incurred but not yet reported and any estimable administrative run-out expenses related to the processing of these outstanding claim payments. Liabilities are determined on a quarterly basis by internal actuaries through an analysis of historical trends, changes in claims experience including consideration of new information and application of loss development factors for the insurance reserves and frequency and severity assumptions for the insurance-related accruals, among other inputs and assumptions. On an annual basis, an independent third-party actuary will evaluate the liabilities for appropriateness with claims reserve valuations. Insurance claims may take years to completely settle, and we have limited historical loss experience. Because of the limited operational history, we make certain assumptions based on currently available information and industry statistics, with the loss development factors as the most significant assumptions related to the insurance reserves and the frequency and severity assumptions as the most significant assumptions related to insurance-related accruals, and utilize actuarial models and techniques to estimate the reserves. A number of factors can affect the actual cost of a claim, including the length of time the claim remains open, economic and healthcare cost trends and the results of related litigation. Furthermore, claims may emerge in future years for events that occurred in a prior year at a rate that differs from previous actuarial projections. The impact of these factors on ultimate costs for insurance is difficult to estimate and could be material. However, while we believe that the insurance reserve and insurance-related accrual amounts are adequate, the ultimate liabilities may be in excess of, or less than, the amounts provided. As a result, the net amounts that will ultimately be paid to settle the liabilities and when amounts will be paid may significantly vary from the estimated amounts provided for in the consolidated balance sheets. We continue to review our insurance reserve estimates in a regular, ongoing process as historical experience develops, additional claims are reported as settled, and the legal, regulatory and economic environment evolves.', ""# Report of Independent Registered Public Accounting Firm\n\n## Valuation of Insurance Reserves\n\nAs described in Note 1 to the consolidated financial statements, insurance reserves is the liability for unpaid losses and loss adjustment expenses, which represents the estimate of the ultimate unpaid obligation for certain risks retained by the Company, including auto liability, uninsured and underinsured motorist, auto physical damage, general liability, and workers' compensation, and includes an amount for case reserves related to reported claims and an amount for losses incurred but not reported as of the balance sheet date. The estimate of the ultimate unpaid obligation utilizes generally accepted actuarial methods applied to historical claim and loss experience. In addition, management uses assumptions based on actuarial judgment related to claim and loss development patterns and expected loss costs, which consider frequency trends, severity trends, and relevant industry data. These reserves are continually reviewed by management and adjusted as experience develops and new information becomes known. The Company's short-term and long-term insurance reserves as of December 31, 2023 totaled $6.7 billion. The principal considerations for our determination that performing procedures relating to the valuation of insurance reserves is a critical audit matter are the significant judgment by management when developing the estimate of the insurance reserves, which in turn led to a high degree of auditor judgment, subjectivity and effort in performing procedures and evaluating audit evidence relating to the actuarial methods and management's significant assumptions related to loss development patterns and expected loss costs. The audit effort also involved the use of professionals with specialized skill and knowledge. Addressing the matter involved performing procedures and evaluating audit evidence in connection with forming our overall opinion on the consolidated financial statements. These procedures included testing the effectiveness of controls relating to the Company's valuation of insurance reserves, including controls over the development of the significant assumptions related to loss development patterns and expected loss costs. These procedures also included, among others, the involvement of professionals with specialized skill and knowledge to assist in (i) developing, for selected reserve components, an independent actuarial estimate of the insurance reserves, and comparison of this independent estimate to management's actuarially determined reserves, and (ii) testing, for other selected reserve components, management's process for estimating the insurance reserves. Developing the independent estimate involved independently developing the loss development patterns and expected loss costs and testing the completeness and accuracy of data provided by management. Testing management's process for estimating the insurance reserves involved evaluating the 72 appropriateness of management's actuarial methods, evaluating the reasonableness of the significant assumptions used by management related to loss development patterns and expected loss costs used in those methods, and testing the completeness and accuracy of data used by management. /s/ PricewaterhouseCoopers LLP San Francisco, California February 15, 2024 We have served as the Company's auditor since 2014. 73""]","Claims reserve valuations in the context of insurance liabilities represent the estimated cost of claims incurred but not yet paid (IBNR), and claims incurred but not yet reported (IBNR).  These valuations are crucial because insurance claims can take years to settle.

Both Lyft (2023 10-K) and Uber (2023 10-K) reports detail this process.  Lyft's internal actuaries determine liabilities quarterly, analyzing historical trends, changes in claims experience, and applying loss development factors.  An independent third-party actuary reviews these valuations annually.  Uber's report highlights that their insurance reserves represent the estimate of the ultimate unpaid obligation for retained risks.  The estimation uses generally accepted actuarial methods applied to historical claim and loss experience, along with management assumptions about claim and loss development patterns and expected loss costs.  Both companies acknowledge the inherent uncertainty and significant judgment involved in these valuations, given the limited historical data and the many factors influencing ultimate claim costs (e.g., litigation, economic trends, healthcare costs).  The ultimate liabilities may differ materially from the estimated amounts.
","The purpose of claims reserve valuations in the context of insurance liabilities is to evaluate the appropriateness of the liabilities recorded for claims incurred but not paid and claims that have been incurred but not yet reported.

19,What risks are associated with the development of noncompetitive products and offerings?,"[""# We are making substantial investments in new offerings and technologies, and may increase such investments in the future. These new ventures are inherently risky, and we may never realize any expected benefits from them.\n\nWe have made substantial investments to develop new offerings and technologies, and we intend to continue investing significant resources in developing new technologies, tools, features, services, products and offerings. For example, through our acquisition of Cornershop, a provider of online grocery delivery in several countries including Mexico and Chile, we expanded our Delivery offering to grocery delivery. Additionally, in October 2021, we acquired The Drizly Group, Inc., which operates an on-demand alcohol marketplace in North America, in order to further expand our Delivery offering to alcohol. In November 2021, our subsidiary Uber Freight acquired Transplace, expanding Uber Freight's business through Transplace's expertise in transportation management. We also plan to invest resources to develop offerings and technologies in the markets in which Postmates operate. If we do not spend our development budget efficiently or effectively on commercially successful and innovative technologies, we may not realize the expected benefits of our strategy. Our new initiatives also have a high degree of risk, as each involves nascent industries and unproven business strategies and technologies with which we have limited or no prior development or operating experience. Because such offerings and technologies are new, they will likely involve claims and liabilities (including, but not limited to, personal injury claims), expenses, regulatory challenges, and other risks, some of which we do not currently anticipate. There can be no assurance that consumer demand for such initiatives will exist or be sustained at the levels that we anticipate, or that any of these initiatives will gain sufficient traction or market acceptance to generate sufficient revenue to offset any new expenses or liabilities associated with these new investments. It is also possible that products and offerings developed by others will render our products and offerings noncompetitive or obsolete. Further, our development efforts with respect to new products, offerings and technologies could distract management from current operations, and will divert capital and other resources from our more established products, offerings and technologies. Even if we are successful in developing new products, offerings or technologies, regulatory authorities may subject us to new rules or restrictions in response to our innovations that could increase our expenses or prevent us from successfully commercializing new products, offerings or technologies. If we do not realize the expected benefits of our investments, our business, financial condition, operating results, and prospects may be harmed."", '# We rely on other third-party service providers and if such third parties do not perform adequately or terminate their relationships with us, our costs may increase and our business, financial condition and results of operations could be adversely affected.\n\nWe use and incorporate technology and intellectual property from third parties into our platform, products, and services. We cannot be certain that such technology, intellectual property, or third parties are not infringing the intellectual property rights of others or that these third parties have sufficient rights to the technology or intellectual property in all jurisdictions in which we may operate. Some of our license agreements may be terminated by our licensors for convenience. If we are unable to obtain or maintain rights to any of this technology because of intellectual property infringement claims brought by third parties against our suppliers and licensors or against us, or if we are unable to continue to obtain the technology or enter into new agreements on commercially reasonable terms, our ability to develop our platform or products containing that technology or provide services using that technology could be severely limited and our business could be harmed. Additionally, if we are unable to access necessary technology from third parties, we may be forced to acquire or develop alternate technology, which may require significant time and effort and may be of lower quality or performance standards and may subject us to certain risks discussed in the preceding paragraph that are currently borne by third parties. This would limit and delay our ability to provide new or competitive offerings and increase our costs. If alternate technology cannot be obtained or developed or if we are unable to develop such alternate technology at commercially reasonable levels of risk, we may not be able to offer certain functionality as part of our offerings, which could adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations. Our advertising business, Lyft Media, is nascent and subject to various risks and uncertainties, which may adversely affect our business and financial results. We have introduced Lyft Media, a media and advertising business from which we earn revenue from third parties who advertise through various offerings on our platform. We have limited experience and operating history offering media and advertising on our platform, and our efforts to develop Lyft Media and generate revenue are still in the early stages. We may never generate sufficient revenue to offset our investment or achieve the returns we expect. Lyft Media and our ability to generate and increase revenue from Lyft Media are subject to various risks and uncertainties, including: • our ability to attract and retain advertisers, particularly because our advertisers do not have long-term commitments with us; our ability to deliver advertisements in an effective manner; 30 our ability to compete effectively for advertising spend, including our ability to create products and offerings that are perceived as valuable to advertisers;']","Based on the provided 10-K excerpts, the risk of developing non-competitive products and offerings stems from several factors:

* **Competition:**  The Uber 10-K explicitly states that ""products and offerings developed by others will render our products and offerings noncompetitive or obsolete.""  This highlights the inherent risk in any technology-driven market where innovation is rapid and competition is fierce.

* **Market Acceptance:** Both Uber and Lyft's filings indirectly address this risk.  Uber mentions the uncertainty of consumer demand for new initiatives and the possibility that these initiatives may not gain sufficient market traction to generate revenue.  Lyft's discussion of its nascent advertising business, Lyft Media, further emphasizes the risk of failing to achieve sufficient market acceptance and revenue generation for new offerings.

* **Resource Allocation:** Uber's 10-K notes that development efforts for new products could distract management from current operations and divert resources from established products. This implies a risk of misallocation of resources, potentially hindering the success of both new and existing offerings.

* **Regulatory Changes:** Uber's filing points out that regulatory authorities may impose new rules or restrictions on innovations, increasing expenses or preventing successful commercialization. This regulatory uncertainty adds another layer of risk to the development of new products and services.

In summary, the risk of developing non-competitive products and offerings is multifaceted and includes the threat of superior competitor offerings, uncertain market demand, inefficient resource allocation, and the potential for unfavorable regulatory changes.  Neither document directly addresses the risk of *internal* factors leading to non-competitive products (e.g., poor product design or inadequate market research), but the risk of resource misallocation indirectly touches upon this.
","The risks associated with the development of noncompetitive products and offerings include the possibility that products developed by others may render our products obsolete, the distraction of management from current operations, the diversion of capital and resources from established products, and the potential for new regulatory rules or restrictions that could increase expenses or hinder successful commercialization.",0.4777058612064439,0.9574488020228148,0.99999999995,1.0,0.88
20,What are the implications of laws regarding cross-border transfers of personal data for businesses operating in multiple jurisdictions?,"[""# Our business is subject to extensive government regulation and oversight relating to the provision of payment and financial services.\n\nAdditionally, we are subject to laws, rules, and regulations regarding cross-border transfers of personal data, including laws relating to transfer of personal data outside the EEA. We rely on transfer mechanisms permitted under these laws. Such mechanisms have received heightened regulatory and judicial scrutiny and have undergone modifications, and a 2020 decision by the Court of Justice of the European Union had cast doubt on the adequacy of all of the formerly-approved mechanisms for transferring personal data from countries in the EEA to certain other countries such as the United States. While in July 2023 the European Commission deemed a new EU-US Data Privacy Framework adequate for personal data transfers from the EU (and the rest of the EEA) to the US, this Framework has been challenged. If we cannot rely on existing mechanisms for transferring personal data from the EEA, the United Kingdom, or other jurisdictions, we may be unable to transfer personal data of Drivers, consumers, or employees in those regions, which could have an adverse effect on our business, financial condition, and operating results, and result in substantial fines, enforcement actions, litigation, injunctive relief, and other penalties that may be costly or that may impact our business. In addition, we may be required to disclose personal data pursuant to demands from government agencies, including from state and city regulators as a requirement for obtaining or maintaining a license or otherwise, from law enforcement agencies, and from intelligence agencies. This disclosure or potential disclosure may result in a failure or perceived failure by us to comply with privacy and data protection policies, notices, laws, rules, and regulations, could result in proceedings or actions against us in the same or other jurisdictions, and could have an adverse impact on our reputation and brand. In addition, Careem has historically shared certain user data with certain government authorities, which conflicts with our global policies regarding data use, sharing, and ownership. We expect to maintain our data use, sharing, and ownership practices for both our business and Careem's business, and doing so may cause our relationship with government authorities in certain jurisdictions to suffer, and may result in such government authorities assessing fines or penalties against us. Further, if any jurisdiction in which we operate changes its laws, rules, or regulations relating to data residency or local computation such that we are unable to comply in a timely manner or at all, we may risk losing our rights to operate in such jurisdictions. This could adversely affect the manner in which we provide our products and offerings and thus materially affect our operations and financial results."", ""# Changes in laws or regulations relating to privacy, data protection or the protection or transfer of personal data, or any actual or perceived failure by us to comply with such laws and regulations or any other obligations relating to privacy, data protection or the protection or transfer of personal data, could adversely affect our business.\n\nWe receive, transmit, store and otherwise process a large volume of personal information and other data relating to users on our platform, as well as other individuals such as our employees. Numerous local, municipal, state, federal and international laws and regulations address privacy, data protection and the collection, storing, sharing, use, disclosure and protection of certain data, including the California Online Privacy Protection Act, the Personal Information Protection and Electronic Documents Act, the Controlling the Assault of Non-Solicited Pornography and Marketing Act, Canada's Anti-Spam Law, the Telephone Consumer Protection Act of 1991, or TCPA, the U.S. Federal Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act of 1996, as amended by the HITECH Act, or HIPAA, Section 5(c) of the Federal Trade Commission Act, the California Consumer Privacy Act, or CCPA, and the California Privacy Rights Act, or CPRA, which became operative as of January 1, 2023. The scope of data protection laws may continually change, through new legislation, amendments to existing legislation and changes in enforcement, and may be inconsistent from one jurisdiction to another. For example, the CPRA requires new disclosures to California consumers and affords such consumers new data rights and abilities to opt-out of certain sharing of personal information. The CPRA provides for fines of up to $7,500 per violation, which can be applied on a per-consumer basis. Aspects of the CPRA and its interpretation and enforcement remain unclear. Additionally, several states in the U.S., including California and other states where we do business, have enacted legislation relating to privacy and information security, and the U.S. federal government and other states are also contemplating federal and state privacy legislation. These new and modified laws, including the CPRA, and other changes in laws or regulations relating to privacy, data protection and information security, particularly any new or modified laws or regulations that require enhanced protection of data or new obligations with regard to data retention, transfer or disclosure, could greatly increase the cost of providing our offerings, require significant changes to our operations and our data processing practices and policies, may require us to incur additional compliance-related costs and expenses, and may even prevent us from providing certain offerings in jurisdictions in which we currently operate and in which we may operate in the future.""]","Both Uber (2023 10-K) and Lyft (2023 10-K) highlight significant risks associated with laws governing cross-border transfers of personal data.  The implications are substantial and multifaceted:

**Uber:**  The 2023 10-K report emphasizes the complexities surrounding data transfers outside the European Economic Area (EEA).  While a new EU-US Data Privacy Framework was deemed adequate in July 2023, its ongoing challenges create uncertainty.  Failure to comply with these regulations could severely impact Uber's operations, leading to:

* **Inability to transfer data:**  This would hinder operations involving Drivers, consumers, and employees in the EEA and other jurisdictions.
* **Financial penalties:**  Substantial fines, enforcement actions, litigation, and injunctive relief are potential consequences.
* **Reputational damage:**  Government demands for data disclosure, even if legally mandated, could damage Uber's reputation and brand.
* **Operational disruptions:** Changes in data residency or local computation requirements could restrict Uber's ability to operate in certain jurisdictions.


**Lyft:** Lyft's 2023 10-K similarly notes the evolving landscape of data protection laws, citing the California Consumer Privacy Act (CCPA) and the California Privacy Rights Act (CPRA) as examples.  Key implications include:

* **Increased costs:**  Compliance with increasingly stringent data protection regulations will raise operational costs.
* **Operational changes:**  Significant alterations to data processing practices and policies may be necessary.
* **Financial penalties:**  The CPRA, for instance, imposes substantial fines (up to $7,500 per violation, per consumer).
* **Operational limitations:**  New laws could restrict Lyft's ability to offer services in certain jurisdictions.
* **Uncertainty:**  The evolving and often inconsistent nature of data protection laws across jurisdictions creates ongoing uncertainty and risk.


In summary, both companies face significant risks stemming from the evolving legal framework around cross-border data transfers.  These risks encompass substantial financial penalties, operational disruptions, and reputational harm.  The lack of clarity and consistency in international data protection laws adds to the complexity and uncertainty faced by these businesses.
","The implications of laws regarding cross-border transfers of personal data for businesses operating in multiple jurisdictions include the reliance on transfer mechanisms permitted under these laws, which have received heightened regulatory and judicial scrutiny. Modifications to these mechanisms and legal decisions, such as the 2020 ruling by the Court of Justice of the European Union, can cast doubt on their adequacy. If businesses cannot rely on existing mechanisms for transferring personal data, they may be unable to transfer personal data of drivers, consumers, or employees, potentially leading to adverse effects on business operations, financial conditions, and results, as well as substantial fines and penalties.",0.3810383015353659,0.8717445348622631,0.99999999995,1.0,0.8095238095238095
21,What services do delivery offerings provide to consumers?,"[""# PART I\n\n## Delivery\n\nOur Delivery offering allows consumers to search for and discover the best of local commerce-from restaurants to grocery, alcohol, convenience and other retailers-order a meal or other items, and either pick-up at the restaurant or have it delivered. We refer to the grocery, alcohol, convenience, and retail categories collectively as Grocery & Retail. After launching our Delivery app, Uber Eats, over eight years ago, we believe our Delivery offering increases consumer engagement with the Uber platform overall, which in turn results in broader reach for our Merchants who can attract Uber Eats consumers from Uber without increasing their own costs. For Drivers, we believe the Delivery offering leverages, and has expanded, our earner base by increasing utilization and earnings across the network. We also believe it also attracts new Drivers to the platform who do not have access to Mobility-qualified vehicles. Over the last several years, our Delivery business has expanded to include Uber Direct, our white-label Delivery-as-a-Service offering to retailers and restaurants around the world, as well as advertising opportunities.\n\n## Freight\n\nWe believe that Freight is revolutionizing the logistics industry. Freight powers a managed transportation and logistics network and connects Shippers and Carriers in a digital marketplace to move shipments while leveraging our proprietary technology, brand awareness, and experience revolutionizing industries. Freight provides an on-demand platform to automate and accelerate logistics transactions end-to-end while providing visibility and control of logistics networks. Freight connects Carriers with Shippers' shipments available on our platform, and gives Carriers upfront, transparent pricing and the ability to book a shipment with the touch of a button. Freight serves Shippers ranging from small- and medium-sized businesses to global enterprises. By leveraging logistics solutions expertise and value-add solutions, Freight enables Shippers to create and tender shipments, secure capacity on demand with real-time pricing, and track those shipments from pickup to delivery. Freight operations are principally based in North America and Europe. We believe that all of these factors represent significant efficiency improvements over traditional transportation management and freight brokerage providers.\n\n## Platform Synergies"", ""# Any actual or perceived security or privacy breach or incident could interrupt our operations, harm our brand and adversely affect our reputation, brand, business, financial condition and results of operations.\n\nWe primarily rely on Amazon Web Services to deliver our offerings to users on our platform, and any disruption of or interference with our use of Amazon Web Services could adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations. We currently host our platform and support our operations using Amazon Web Services, or AWS, a third-party provider of cloud infrastructure services. We do not have control over the operations of the facilities of AWS that we use. AWS' facilities are vulnerable to damage or interruption from natural disasters, cybersecurity attacks, terrorist attacks, power outages and similar events or acts of misconduct. Our platform's continuing and uninterrupted performance is critical to our success. We have experienced, and expect that in the future we will experience interruptions, delays and outages in service and availability from time to time due to a variety of factors, including infrastructure changes, human or software errors, website hosting disruptions and capacity constraints. In addition, any changes in AWS' service levels may adversely affect our ability to meet the requirements of users. Since our platform's continuing and uninterrupted performance is critical to our success, sustained or repeated system failures would reduce the attractiveness of our offerings. It may become increasingly difficult to maintain and improve our performance, especially during peak usage times, as we expand and the usage of our offerings increases. Any negative publicity arising from these disruptions could harm our reputation and brand and may adversely affect the usage of our offerings. Our commercial agreement with AWS will remain in effect until terminated by AWS or us. AWS may only terminate the agreement for convenience after complying with a one-year advance notice requirement. AWS may also terminate the agreement for cause upon a breach of the agreement or for failure to pay amounts due, in each case, subject to AWS providing prior written notice and a 30-day cure period. In the event that our agreement with AWS is terminated or we add additional cloud infrastructure service providers, we may experience significant costs or downtime in connection with the transfer to, or the addition of, new cloud infrastructure service providers. Any of the above circumstances or events may harm our reputation and brand, reduce the availability or usage of our platform, lead to a significant short term loss of revenue, increase our costs and impair our ability to attract new users, any of which could adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations.""]","Based on the provided Uber 10-K report (2023), the Delivery offering allows consumers to:

1. **Search and discover local businesses:** This includes restaurants, grocery stores, alcohol retailers, convenience stores, and other retailers.
2. **Order meals and other items:** Consumers can place orders through the Uber Eats app.
3. **Choose between pickup or delivery:**  Consumers can opt to pick up their orders themselves or have them delivered.

The report highlights that Uber's Delivery offering aims to increase consumer engagement with the Uber platform overall, benefiting both consumers and merchants (by expanding reach without increased costs for merchants) and drivers (by increasing utilization, earnings, and attracting new drivers).  The Delivery business also includes Uber Direct (a white-label Delivery-as-a-Service) and advertising opportunities.

22,What impact have TNC laws had on the ridesharing industry and its business model?,"['# Our business is subject to a wide range of laws and regulations, many of which are evolving, and failure to comply with such laws and regulations could harm our business, financial condition and results of operations.\n\nThe ridesharing industry, Light Vehicle sharing industry and our business model are relatively nascent and rapidly evolving. When we introduced a peer-to-peer ridesharing marketplace in 2012, the laws and regulations in place at the time did not directly address our offerings. Laws and regulations that were in existence at that time, and some that have since been adopted, were often applied to our industry and our business in a manner that limited our relationships with drivers or otherwise inhibited the growth of our ridesharing marketplace. We have been proactively working with federal, state and local governments and regulatory bodies to ensure that our ridesharing marketplace and other offerings are available broadly in the United States and Canada. In part due to our efforts, a large majority of U.S. states have adopted laws related to TNCs to address the unique issues of the ridesharing industry. New laws and regulations and changes to existing laws and regulations continue to be adopted, implemented and interpreted in response to our industry and related technologies. As we expand our business into new markets or introduce new offerings into existing markets, regulatory bodies or courts may claim that we or users on our platform are subject to additional requirements, or that we are prohibited from conducting our business in certain jurisdictions, or that users on our platform are prohibited from using our platform, either generally or with respect to certain offerings. Certain jurisdictions and governmental entities, including airports, require us to obtain permits, pay fees or comply with certain reporting and other operational requirements to provide our ridesharing, bike and scooter sharing, and Flexdrive offerings. These jurisdictions and governmental entities may reject our applications for permits, revoke or suspend existing or deny renewals of permits to operate, delay our ability to operate, increase their fees, charge new types of fees, or impose fines and penalties, including as a result of errors in, or failures to comply with, reporting or other requirements related to our product offerings. Any of the foregoing actions by these jurisdictions and governmental entities could adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations.', '# PART I\n\n## Government Regulation\n\nWe operate in a particularly complex legal and regulatory environment. Our business is subject to a variety of U.S. federal, state, local and foreign laws, rules, and regulations, including those related to Internet activities, privacy, cybersecurity, data protection, intellectual property, competition, consumer protection, payments, labor and employment, transportation services, transportation network companies, licensing regulations and taxation. These laws and regulations are constantly evolving and may be interpreted, applied, created, or amended, in a manner that could harm our business. Examples of certain laws and regulations we are subject to are described below. For further discussion of risks relating to government regulation, see our risk factors, including the risk factors in the section titled ""Legal and Regulatory Risks Related to Our Business"" in Part I, Item 1A of this Annual Report on Form 10-K. Our platform, and in particular our Mobility products, are subject to differing, and sometimes conflicting, laws, rules, and regulations in the numerous jurisdictions in which we operate. A large number of proposals are before various national, regional, and local legislative bodies and regulatory entities, both within the United States and in foreign jurisdictions, regarding issues related to our business model. In the United States, many state and local laws, rules, and regulations impose legal restrictions and other requirements on operating our Mobility products, including licensing, insurance, screening, and background check requirements. Outside of the United States, certain jurisdictions have adopted similar laws, rules, and regulations while other jurisdictions have not adopted any laws, rules, and regulations which govern our Mobility business. Further, certain jurisdictions, including Argentina, Germany, Italy, Japan, South Korea, and Spain, six countries that we have identified as expansion markets, have adopted laws, rules, and regulations banning certain ridesharing products or imposing extensive operational restrictions. This uncertainty and fragmented regulatory environment creates significant complexities for our business and operating model. In addition, our Delivery and Freight products are also subject to laws, regulations and standards that govern the transportation of food, alcohol and other goods. Substantially all states in the United States and numerous municipalities in the United States and around the world have adopted Transportation Network Company (""TNC"") regulations. These regulations generally focus on companies that operate websites or mobile apps that connect individual drivers with their own vehicles to passengers willing to pay to be driven to their destinations. These regulations often require TNCs to comply with rules regarding, among other things, background checks, vehicle inspections, accessible vehicles, driver and consumer safety, insurance, driver training, driver conduct, and other similar matters.']","Based on the provided 10-K excerpts from Lyft and Uber, the impact of Transportation Network Company (TNC) laws on the ridesharing industry and its business model is multifaceted:

**Initial Phase:**  When ridesharing platforms emerged (around 2012), existing laws didn't directly address their business model.  Pre-existing regulations were often applied in ways that limited driver relationships and inhibited marketplace growth (Lyft 10-K).

**Subsequent Regulation:** A significant majority of U.S. states have since enacted TNC-specific laws to address the unique challenges of the industry (Lyft 10-K).  These laws are constantly evolving, being interpreted, amended, and implemented (Lyft & Uber 10-Ks).  This creates a complex and sometimes conflicting regulatory environment across different jurisdictions (Uber 10-K).

**Specific Regulatory Requirements:** TNC regulations generally focus on areas such as:

* **Background checks:**  For drivers.
* **Vehicle inspections:** Ensuring vehicle safety and compliance.
* **Accessible vehicles:**  Meeting accessibility requirements for passengers with disabilities.
* **Driver and consumer safety:** Implementing safety measures and protocols.
* **Insurance:**  Maintaining adequate insurance coverage.
* **Driver training:**  Providing training to drivers.
* **Driver conduct:**  Establishing standards of conduct for drivers.

**Challenges and Uncertainties:**

* **Conflicting regulations:**  The fragmented regulatory landscape across different jurisdictions presents significant operational complexities (Uber 10-K).
* **Bans and restrictions:** Some jurisdictions have even banned certain ridesharing products or imposed extensive operational restrictions (Uber 10-K, citing specific countries).
* **Permitting and fees:**  Companies must obtain permits, pay fees, and comply with reporting requirements in various jurisdictions, facing potential rejection of applications, permit revocation, or increased fees (Lyft 10-K).
* **Ongoing evolution:** The continuous evolution of laws and regulations creates uncertainty and necessitates ongoing adaptation by companies.


In summary, TNC laws have moved from a period of regulatory ambiguity to a situation of complex and evolving regulations. While these laws aim to address safety and other concerns, they also create significant operational challenges and uncertainties for ridesharing companies.  The impact is a need for ongoing compliance efforts and adaptation to a constantly shifting regulatory landscape.
","TNC laws have been applied to the ridesharing industry and its business model in a manner that has often limited relationships with drivers and inhibited the growth of the ridesharing marketplace. However, due to proactive efforts, a large majority of U.S. states have adopted laws related to TNCs to address the unique issues of the ridesharing industry, which has allowed for broader availability of ridesharing services in the United States and Canada.",0.3931796397774051,0.0,0.99999999995,0.6666666666666666,1.0

We have previously acquired and invested in, and we continue to seek to acquire and invest in businesses, technologies, or other assets that we believe could complement or expand our business, including acquisitions of new lines of business and other opportunities that operate in relatively nascent markets. We also may explore investments in new technologies, which we may develop or other parties may develop. The identification, evaluation, and negotiation of potential acquisition or strategic investment transactions may divert the attention of management and entail various expenses, whether or not such transactions are ultimately completed. There can be no assurance that we will be successful in identifying, negotiating, and consummating favorable transaction opportunities. These transactions involve numerous risks, whether or not completed, any of which could harm our business and negatively affect our financial condition and results of operations, including: intense competition for suitable acquisition and investment targets, which could increase transaction costs and adversely affect our ability to consummate deals on favorable or acceptable terms; • failure or material delay in closing a transaction; • transaction-related lawsuits or claims; • our ability to successfully obtain indemnification or representation and warranty insurance; difficulties in integrating the technologies, operations, existing contracts and personnel of an acquired company; • challenges related to entering into new markets or geographies; • difficulties in retaining key employees or business partners of an acquired company; • diversion of financial and management resources from existing operations or alternative acquisition opportunities; • failure to realize the anticipated benefits or synergies of a transaction; failure to identify the problems, liabilities or other shortcomings or challenges of an acquired company or technology, including issues related to intellectual property, regulatory compliance practices, litigation, revenue recognition or other accounting practices, or employee or user issues; • acquired businesses or businesses that we invest in may not have adequate controls, processes, and procedures to ensure compliance with laws and regulations, including with respect to data privacy, data protection, and data security, as well as anti-bribery and anti-corruption laws, export controls, sanctions and industry-specific-regulation; • risks that regulatory bodies may enact new laws or promulgate new regulations that are adverse to an acquired company or business, or the risk that we become subject to new or additional regulatory burdens that affect our business in potentially unanticipated and significantly negative ways; • theft of our trade secrets or confidential information that we share with potential acquisition candidates;', ""# If we are unable to successfully identify, acquire and integrate suitable businesses, our operating results and prospects could be harmed, and any businesses we acquire may not perform as expected or be effectively integrated.\n\nAs part of our business strategy, we have entered into, and expect to continue to enter into, agreements to acquire companies, form joint ventures, divest portions or aspects of our business, sell minority stakes in portions or aspects of our business, and acquire complementary companies or technologies. Competition within our industry for acquisitions of businesses, technologies, and assets is intense. As such, even if we are able to identify a target for acquisition, we may not be able to complete the acquisition on commercially reasonable terms, we may not be able to receive approval from the applicable competition authorities, or such target may be acquired by another company, including one of our competitors. Further, negotiations for potential acquisitions or other transactions may result in the diversion of our management's time and significant out-of-pocket costs. We may expend significant cash or incur substantial debt to finance such acquisitions, and such indebtedness may restrict our business or require the use of available cash to make interest and principal payments. In addition, we may finance or otherwise complete acquisitions by issuing equity or convertible debt securities, which may result in dilution to our stockholders, or if such convertible debt securities are not converted, significant cash outlays. If we fail to evaluate and execute acquisitions or other strategic transactions successfully or fail to successfully address any of these risks, our business, financial condition, and operating results may be harmed. In addition, any businesses we acquire may not perform as well as we expect. Failure to manage and successfully integrate acquired businesses and technologies, including managing internal controls and any privacy, data security or Al risks associated with such acquisitions, may harm our operating results and expansion prospects. For example, Careem has historically shared certain user data with certain government authorities, which conflicts with our global policies regarding data use, sharing, and ownership. We have maintained our data use, sharing, and ownership practices for both our business and Careem's business, and doing so may cause our relationships with government authorities in certain jurisdictions to suffer, and may result in such government authorities assessing fines or penalties against us. The process of integrating an acquired company, business, or technology or acquired personnel into our company is subject to various risks and challenges, including: diverting management time and focus from operating our business to acquisition integration; disrupting our ongoing business operations; platform user acceptance of the acquired company's offerings; implementing or remediating the controls, procedures, and policies of the acquired company; integrating the acquired business onto our systems and ensuring the acquired business meets our financial reporting requirements and timelines;""]","Based on the provided 10-K excerpts from Lyft and Uber, several risks are associated with strategic transactions as part of their business strategies:

**Challenges in Identifying and Completing Transactions:**

* **Intense Competition:**  Both Lyft and Uber highlight the intense competition for suitable acquisition targets, leading to increased transaction costs and potentially unfavorable terms or the inability to complete deals.  (Lyft and Uber 10-Ks)
* **Failure to Close or Material Delays:**  The possibility of failing to close a transaction or experiencing significant delays is a significant risk. (Uber 10-K)
* **Transaction-Related Lawsuits or Claims:** Litigation arising from transactions is a potential negative outcome. (Lyft 10-K)
* **Difficulty Obtaining Indemnification/Insurance:** Securing adequate indemnification or warranty insurance can be challenging. (Lyft 10-K)


**Integration Challenges:**

* **Integration Difficulties:**  Both companies mention the difficulties in integrating acquired companies' technologies, operations, contracts, and personnel. This includes challenges related to entering new markets or geographies and retaining key employees or business partners. (Lyft and Uber 10-Ks)
* **Failure to Realize Anticipated Benefits/Synergies:**  There's a risk that the expected benefits or synergies from a transaction may not materialize. (Lyft 10-K)
* **Unforeseen Problems/Liabilities:**  Acquired companies may have hidden problems, liabilities, or shortcomings related to intellectual property, regulatory compliance, litigation, accounting practices, or employee/user issues. (Lyft 10-K)
* **Inadequate Controls/Compliance:** Acquired businesses may lack adequate controls and procedures to ensure compliance with laws and regulations (data privacy, data security, anti-bribery, export controls, sanctions, etc.). (Lyft 10-K)
* **Regulatory Risks:** New laws or regulations could negatively impact acquired companies or subject the acquiring company to new burdens. (Lyft 10-K)
* **Data Security and Privacy Risks:**  Integrating acquired companies may present challenges in managing internal controls and privacy, data security, or AI risks.  (Uber 10-K, specifically mentioning Careem's data sharing practices).
* **Diversion of Resources:**  Focusing on acquisitions can divert financial and management resources from existing operations or other opportunities. (Lyft 10-K)


**Financial Risks:**

* **High Costs:**  Acquisitions can be expensive, requiring significant cash outlays or debt, potentially restricting future business activities or requiring the use of available cash for debt servicing. (Uber 10-K)
* **Equity Dilution:**  Financing acquisitions through equity issuance can dilute existing shareholders' ownership. (Uber 10-K)
* **Theft of Confidential Information:** Sharing confidential information with potential acquisition candidates exposes the company to the risk of trade secret theft. (Lyft 10-K)


**Performance Risks:**

* **Underperformance of Acquired Businesses:** Acquired businesses may not perform as well as expected. (Uber 10-K)


In summary, the risks associated with strategic transactions are multifaceted and encompass challenges related to deal completion, integration, regulatory compliance, financial strain, and the potential for acquired businesses to underperform.  Both Lyft and Uber acknowledge these risks as inherent to their growth strategies.
","The potential risks associated with strategic transactions as part of a business strategy include intense competition for suitable acquisition and investment targets, failure or material delay in closing a transaction, transaction-related lawsuits or claims, difficulties in integrating the technologies and operations of an acquired company, challenges related to entering new markets, difficulties in retaining key employees, diversion of financial and management resources, failure to realize anticipated benefits or synergies, failure to identify problems or liabilities of an acquired company, inadequate controls and compliance issues, new adverse regulations, theft of trade secrets, and the risk that an acquired company cannibalizes existing business.",0.9795071202962009,0.9132177735709602,0.99999999995,0.9230769230769231,0.8679245283018868

These provisions could also discourage proxy contests and make it more difficult for stockholders to elect directors of their choosing and to cause us to take other corporate actions they desire, any of which, under certain circumstances, could limit the opportunity for our stockholders to receive a premium for their shares of our Class A common stock, and could also affect the price that some investors are willing to pay for our Class A common stock.

The Uber 10-K excerpt states that in derivative actions (where a shareholder sues on behalf of the company), indemnification for expenses will not be made if the Indemnitee (the person being indemnified) is found liable unless the Delaware Court of Chancery (or the court where the proceeding was brought) determines that indemnification is ""fairly and reasonably entitled"" despite the liability finding.

The Lyft 10-K excerpt does *not* discuss indemnification.  It focuses on the Court of Chancery's role as the exclusive forum for various types of disputes between Lyft and its stockholders, including derivative actions and claims of breach of fiduciary duty.  This means the Court of Chancery has jurisdiction over these specific types of cases involving Lyft, but not necessarily over all indemnification disputes.  The excerpt highlights that the Court of Chancery's jurisdiction is subject to the court having jurisdiction over indispensable parties.

27,What are the data breach obligations for businesses under GDPR vs. CCPA and LGPD?,"['# Our business is subject to extensive government regulation and oversight relating to the provision of payment and financial services.\n\nThis risk is enhanced in certain jurisdictions with stringent privacy laws and, as we expand our products, offerings, and operations domestically and internationally, we have, and may continue to become subject to amended or additional laws that impose substantial additional obligations related to data privacy and security. The EU adopted the GDPR in 2016, and it became effective in May 2018. The GDPR applies extraterritorially and imposes stringent requirements for controllers and processors of personal data. Such requirements include higher consent standards to process personal data, robust disclosures regarding the use of personal data, strengthened individual data rights, data breach requirements, limitations on data retention, strengthened requirements for special categories of personal data and pseudonymised (i.e., key-coded) data, and additional obligations for contracting with service providers that may process personal data. In addition, the GDPR contains a provision that individuals shall have the right not to be subject to a decision based solely on automated processing, including profiling, which produces legal effects concerning them or similarly significantly affects them. Decisions by us based on AI or automated processing of data, or insufficient disclosures regarding this processing, have and could impair our business and have and could subject us to lawsuits, regulatory investigations or other harm. The GDPR further provides that EU member states may institute additional laws and regulations impacting the processing of personal data, including (i) special categories of personal data (e.g., racial or ethnic origin, political opinions, and religious or philosophical beliefs) and (ii) profiling of individuals and automated individual decision-making. Such additional laws and regulations could limit our ability to use and share personal or other data, thereby increasing our costs and harming our business and financial condition. Non-compliance with the GDPR (including any non-compliance by any acquired business) is subject to significant penalties, including fines of up to the greater of €20 million or 4% of total worldwide revenue, and injunctions against the processing of personal data. Other jurisdictions outside the EU are similarly introducing or enhancing privacy and data security laws, rules, and regulations, including for automated processing, decision making, and profiling, which will increase our compliance costs and the risks associated with non-compliance. For example, the California Consumer Privacy Act (""CCPA""), which provided new privacy rights for consumers and new operational requirements for businesses, went into effect in January 2020. The CCPA includes a statutory damages framework and private rights of action against businesses that fail to comply with certain CCPA terms or implement reasonable security procedures and practices to prevent data breaches. Other U.S. states have adopted, and likely will continue to 38', '# Changes in laws or regulations relating to privacy, data protection or the protection or transfer of personal data, or any actual or perceived failure by us to comply with such laws and regulations or any other obligations relating to privacy, data protection or the protection or transfer of personal data, could adversely affect our business.\n\nregulations such as the CCPA and CPRA imposing new and relatively burdensome obligations, and with substantial uncertainty over the interpretation and application of these and other laws and regulations, we may face challenges in addressing their requirements and making necessary changes to our policies and practices, and may incur significant costs and expenses in an effort to do so. In particular, with regard to HIPAA, we may incur increased costs as we perform our obligations to our healthcare customers under our agreements with them. As we consider expansion of business offerings and markets and as laws and regulations change, we expect to incur additional costs related to privacy, data protection and information security standards and protocols imposed by laws, regulations, industry standards or contractual obligations related to such offerings and face additional risks that such expansion could be inconsistent with, or fail or be alleged to fail to meet all requirements of such laws, regulations or obligations. Despite our efforts to comply with applicable laws, regulations and other obligations relating to privacy, data protection and information security, it is possible that our practices, offerings or platform could be inconsistent with, or fail or be alleged to fail to meet all requirements of, such laws, regulations or obligations. Our failure, or the failure by our third-party providers or partners, to comply with applicable laws, regulations or other actual or asserted obligations relating to privacy, data protection or information security, or any compromise of security that results in unauthorized access to, or unauthorized loss, unavailability, corruption, use, release or other processing of personal information or other driver or rider data, or the perception that any of the foregoing types of failure or compromise has occurred, could damage our reputation, discourage new and existing drivers and riders from using our platform or result in fines or proceedings by governmental agencies and private claims and litigation, any of which could adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations. Additionally, the perception of concerns relating to privacy, data protection or information security, whether or not valid, may harm our reputation and brand and adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations.']","The provided 10-K reports for Uber (2023) and Lyft (2023) discuss data breach obligations under GDPR and CCPA, but not LGPD.  Neither report details specific obligations under LGPD.  To obtain information on LGPD data breach obligations, you would need to consult the LGPD itself or other relevant legal resources, not these 10-K filings.

Here's a summary of what the reports *do* say regarding GDPR and CCPA:

**GDPR:**

* **Uber (2023):**  The report highlights that non-compliance with GDPR is subject to significant penalties, including fines up to the greater of €20 million or 4% of total worldwide revenue, and injunctions against processing personal data.  The report also mentions the GDPR's requirements for higher consent standards, robust disclosures, strengthened individual data rights, data breach requirements, limitations on data retention, and obligations for contracting with service providers.

* **Lyft (2023):**  The Lyft report doesn't explicitly detail GDPR's data breach obligations but mentions that changes in laws relating to privacy and data protection, or failure to comply, could adversely affect their business.  This implicitly acknowledges the existence of data breach requirements under GDPR, but doesn't specify the penalties.


**CCPA:**

* **Uber (2023):** The report mentions the CCPA's existence and notes that it imposes new obligations on businesses.  However, it does not detail specific data breach obligations under the CCPA.

* **Lyft (2023):** The Lyft report mentions the CCPA and CPRA (California Privacy Rights Act), highlighting that they impose new and burdensome obligations.  It also states that failure to comply with privacy laws, including the CCPA, could result in fines or proceedings by governmental agencies and private claims and litigation.  Again, specific data breach obligations are not detailed.


In short, while both reports acknowledge the existence and impact of GDPR and CCPA, they lack specific details on the data breach obligations under these regulations.  To get a complete picture of the data breach obligations under GDPR, CCPA, and LGPD, you'll need to consult the legal texts of these regulations and related legal interpretations.
","The context does not provide specific details about the data breach obligations for businesses under GDPR, CCPA, and LGPD. It mentions that non-compliance with GDPR can lead to significant penalties, including fines and injunctions, and that the CCPA includes a statutory damages framework and private rights of action against businesses that fail to comply with its terms. However, it does not explicitly outline the obligations under each regulation.",0.41610063331482394,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.7272727272727273

The credit agreement also contains customary events of default. The Revolving Credit Facility also contains restrictions on the payment of dividends. On July 28, 2023, we entered into a joinder agreement to our Revolving Credit Facility to add an incremental revolving loan lender and increase the available commitments under the Revolving Credit Facility by an aggregate principal amount of $250 million. The joinder agreement brings the total revolver capacity to approximately $2.5 billion. There were no changes to the pricing or maturity of the Revolving Credit Facility.

**Lyft:**

* **Interest:**  Interest on loans is variable, based on either the Adjusted Term SOFR Rate plus a variable rate tied to the company's total leverage ratio (ranging from 1.50% to 2.25%), or a rate based on the prime rate, federal funds rate, or SOFR, plus a variable rate based on leverage (ranging from 0.05% to 1.25%).  The choice of interest rate calculation is at Lyft's option.
* **Commitment Fee:** Lyft pays an annual commitment fee on the undrawn portion of the facility, ranging from 0.225% to 0.375%, depending on its total leverage ratio.
* **Covenants:**  The agreement includes covenants restricting Lyft's ability to incur additional debt, create liens, merge, make certain dispositions, pay dividends, engage in transactions with affiliates, and make certain investments and acquisitions.  It also mandates maintaining a minimum liquidity amount ($1.5 billion through June 30, 2024, then subject to change based on leverage ratios and acquisitions), a maximum total leverage ratio (initially 3.50:1.00, then potentially 3.00:1.00), and a minimum fixed charge coverage ratio (1.25:1.00).  Breaching these covenants could lead to the full or partial principal balance becoming due.
* **Impact on Liquidity and Capital Needs:** The covenants directly impact Lyft's liquidity and capital needs by setting minimum liquidity requirements and restricting actions that could strain its financial position.  Meeting these covenants is crucial for maintaining access to the credit facility.

**Uber:**

* **Interest:** Uber's interest expense from long-term debt (which includes the revolving credit facility) totaled $595 million in 2023, comprised of contractual interest coupon and amortization of debt discount and issuance costs.  Specific interest rates for the revolving credit facility are not explicitly detailed in this excerpt, but the provided table shows the total interest expense.
* **Covenants:** The agreement includes customary covenants restricting Uber's and its subsidiaries' ability to incur debt, incur liens, and undergo certain fundamental changes, as well as maintaining a specified liquidity level.  The agreement also contains restrictions on dividend payments.  The minimum liquidity covenant was reduced from $1.5 billion to $1.0 billion in an amendment.
* **Impact on Liquidity and Capital Needs:** Similar to Lyft, the covenants influence Uber's liquidity and capital needs.  The reduction in the minimum liquidity covenant suggests a change in their capital needs and risk assessment.  The fact that there was no outstanding balance on the facility at the end of 2023 indicates that they did not need to draw on it.

**Comparison:** Both companies utilize revolving credit facilities with variable interest rates and covenants designed to manage their liquidity and capital structure.  While specific interest rate details differ in the provided excerpts, both facilities include restrictions on debt, dividends, and other financial actions.  The provided Uber excerpt shows the total interest expense, while the Lyft excerpt details the interest rate calculation methodology.  Both companies had no outstanding balance on their primary revolving credit facilities at the end of 2023.  However, Uber also had a separate revolving credit facility for Freight Holding, which also had no outstanding balance at year-end.
","The main financial duties of the Revolving Credit Facility include paying interest on loans and other customary fees, such as an upfront fee and an unused commitment fee. The interest rate is determined based on certain market rates as set forth in the credit agreement. These obligations impact liquidity and capital needs by requiring the company to manage its cash flow effectively, especially in light of the uncertain macroeconomic environment. The company believes it has sufficient liquidity to meet its working capital and capital expenditures needs for at least the next 12 months, with $1.7 billion in unrestricted cash and cash equivalents and short-term investments as of December 31, 2023.",0.4214330119962055,0.9011300179637924,0.99999999995,,0.5
29,"What factors influence deferred tax assets, given tax uncertainties and insurance reserves?","[""# Income Taxes\n\nWe are subject to income taxes in the United States and foreign jurisdictions. We account for income taxes using the asset and liability method. The establishment of deferred tax assets from intra-entity transfers of intangible assets requires management to make significant estimates and assumptions to determine the fair value of such intangible assets. Significant estimates in valuing intangible assets may include, but are not necessarily limited to, internal revenue and expense forecasts, the estimated life of the intangible assets, comparable transaction values, and/or discount rates. The discount rates used to discount expected future cash flows to present value are derived from a weighted-average cost of capital analysis and are adjusted to reflect the inherent risks related to the cash flow. Although we believe the assumptions and estimates we have made are reasonable and appropriate, they are based, in part, on historical experience, internal and external comparable data and are inherently uncertain. Unanticipated events and circumstances may occur that could affect either the accuracy or validity of such assumptions, estimates or actual results. We account for uncertainty in tax positions by recognizing a tax benefit from uncertain tax positions when it is more-likely-than-not that the position will be sustained upon examination. Evaluating our uncertain tax positions and determining our provision for income taxes are inherently uncertain and require making judgments, assumptions, and estimates. While we believe we have adequately reserved for our uncertain tax positions, no assurance can be given that the final tax outcome of these matters will not be different. We adjust these reserves in light of changing facts and circumstances, such as the closing of a tax audit. To the extent that the final tax outcome of these matters is different than the amounts recorded, such differences may impact the provision for income taxes and the effective tax rate in the period in which such determination is made. The provision for income taxes includes the impact of reserve provisions and changes to reserves as well as the related net interest and penalties. In addition, we are subject to the continuous examination of our income tax returns by the IRS and other tax authorities which may assert assessments against us. We regularly assess the likelihood of adverse outcomes resulting from these examinations and assessments to determine the adequacy of our provision for income taxes. Based on available evidence, management believes it is not more-likely-than-not that the net U.S., Netherlands, and other non-material jurisdictions' deferred tax assets will be fully realizable. In these jurisdictions, we have recorded a valuation allowance against net deferred tax assets. We regularly review the deferred tax assets for recoverability based on historical taxable income, projected future taxable income, excess tax benefits related to stock-based compensation, the expected timing of the reversals of existing taxable temporary differences and tax planning strategies by jurisdiction.

The Company believes that, based on a number of factors, the available objective evidence creates sufficient uncertainty regarding the realizability of the deferred tax assets such that a valuation allowance has been recorded. These factors include the Company's history of net losses. 119 As of December 31, 2023, the Company had U.S. federal and state net operating loss carryforwards of approximately $7.7 billion and $6.4 billion, respectively. The federal net operating loss carryforwards generated through December 31, 2017 expire at various dates beginning in 2034 and will continue to expire through 2037, while federal net operating loss carryforwards generated in 2018 or later do not expire. The state net operating loss carryovers will begin to expire in 2024 and will continue to expire at various times depending upon individual state carryforward rules. Utilization of the net operating loss carryforwards are subject to various limitations including the ownership change limitations provided by Internal Revenue Code (IRC) Section 382 and similar state provisions. The Company is subject to taxation in the United States and various foreign jurisdictions. All net operating losses generated to date are subject to adjustment for U.S. federal and state income tax purposes. Additionally, all tax years remain open to examination as of December 31, 2023 with the exception of tax years beginning before 2019 in Canada and 2022 in the United Kingdom.""]","Several factors influence deferred tax assets, particularly given tax uncertainties and insurance reserves.  Based on the provided 10-K excerpts from Uber and Lyft, these factors include:

**1.  Valuation of Intangible Assets (Uber):**  The establishment of deferred tax assets from intra-entity transfers of intangible assets relies heavily on estimations.  These estimations involve internal revenue and expense forecasts, the intangible assets' estimated life, comparable transaction values, and discount rates derived from a weighted-average cost of capital analysis.  The inherent uncertainty in these estimations directly impacts the value of the deferred tax asset.

**2. Uncertainty in Tax Positions (Uber):**  Both companies acknowledge the inherent uncertainty in evaluating uncertain tax positions and determining the provision for income taxes.  This involves judgments, assumptions, and estimates.  The possibility of adverse outcomes from IRS and other tax authority examinations further contributes to this uncertainty.  Uber explicitly states that a valuation allowance is recorded against net deferred tax assets because it's not ""more-likely-than-not"" that they will be fully realizable.

**3.  Net Operating Losses (NOLs) and Their Carryforwards (Lyft):** Lyft's significant net operating loss carryforwards (NOLs) are a major component of its deferred tax assets.  However, the utilization of these NOLs is subject to limitations, including ownership change limitations under IRC Section 382 and similar state provisions.  The expiration dates of these NOLs also introduce uncertainty regarding their future realization.  The length of time until expiration (Lyft mentions expirations beginning in 2034 and continuing through 2037 for federal NOLs) significantly impacts the value of the deferred tax asset.

**4.  Insurance Reserves and Accruals (Lyft):**  Lyft's deferred tax assets include a component related to insurance reserves and accruals.  The ultimate cost of these reserves is uncertain, which in turn affects the related deferred tax asset.

**5.  Future Profitability (Uber):** Uber's ability to realize its deferred tax assets depends on its future profitability.  Factors such as market conditions and the successful execution of business plans and tax planning strategies will influence whether these assets can be utilized.

**6.  Tax Audits and Assessments (Uber):**  Both companies are subject to ongoing tax audits, and the potential for assessments against them introduces further uncertainty into the valuation of deferred tax assets.  The outcome of these audits could significantly impact the provision for income taxes and the effective tax rate.


In summary, the valuation of deferred tax assets is significantly influenced by the inherent uncertainties in estimating future taxable income, the timing of tax benefits, the outcome of tax audits, and the limitations on utilizing NOL carryforwards.  The presence of insurance reserves and accruals adds another layer of uncertainty.
","The factors influencing deferred tax assets include management's significant estimates and assumptions regarding the fair value of intangible assets, internal revenue and expense forecasts, the estimated life of the intangible assets, comparable transaction values, and discount rates. Additionally, the recoverability of deferred tax assets is regularly reviewed based on historical taxable income, projected future taxable income, excess tax benefits related to stock-based compensation, and tax planning strategies by jurisdiction. The ultimate liability for insurance reserves is also influenced by actuarial judgment related to claim and loss development patterns and expected experience, which can affect the accuracy of estimates related to deferred tax assets.",0.6765503963784899,0.9029962714842231,0.99999999995,0.6666666666666666,0.7222222222222222
30,How does the equity method affect net income per share with net operating loss carryforwards and diluted earnings?,"[""# Equity Method Investments\n\nWe account for investments in the common stock or in-substance common stock of entities that provide us with the ability to exercise significant influence, but not a controlling financial interest, using the equity method. Investments accounted for under the equity method are initially recorded at cost. Subsequently, we recognize through the consolidated statements of operations, and as an adjustment to the investment balance, our proportionate share of the investee entities' net income or loss, and the amortization of basis differences. In accounting for these investments, we record our share of the entities' net income or loss one quarter in arrears. Equity method investments for which the fair value option is elected are measured at fair value on a recurring basis with changes in fair value reflected in earnings. We review our equity method investments for impairment whenever events or changes in business circumstances indicate that the carrying value of the investment may not be fully recoverable. Qualitative and quantitative factors considered as indicators of a potential impairment include financial results and operating trends of the investees, implied values in transactions of the investee's securities, severity and length of decline in value, and our intention for holding the investment, among other factors. If an impairment is determined to be other-than-temporary, the fair value of the impaired investment would have to be determined and an impairment charge recorded for the difference between the fair value and the carrying value of the investment. The fair value determination, particularly for investments in privately held companies, requires significant judgment to determine appropriate estimates and assumptions. Changes in these estimates and assumptions could affect the calculation of the fair value of the investments and the determination of the impairment charges."", '# Net Loss Per Share\n\nThe Company follows the two-class method when computing net loss per common share when shares are issued that meet the definition of participating securities. The two-class method determines net loss per common share for each class of common stock and participating securities according to dividends declared or accumulated and participation rights in undistributed earnings. The two-class method requires income available to common stockholders for the period to be allocated between common stock and participating securities based upon their respective rights to receive dividends as if all income for the period had been distributed. The Company had no participating securities outstanding during any of the periods presented. Basic net loss per share is computed by dividing the net loss by the weighted-average number of shares of common stock outstanding during the period. The diluted net loss per share is computed by giving effect to all potentially dilutive securities outstanding for the period. For periods in which the Company reports net losses, diluted net loss per common share attributable to common stockholders is the same as basic net loss per common share attributable to common stockholders, because potentially dilutive common shares are not assumed to have been issued if their effect is anti-dilutive. 92\n\n# Variable Interest Entities\n\nIn accordance with Accounting Standards Codification Topic 810, Consolidation (""ASC 810""), the Company evaluates its ownership, contractual and other interests in entities to assess whether it has a variable interest in entities in which it has a financial relationship and, if so, whether or not those entities are variable interest entities (""VIEs""). These evaluations are complex, involving judgment and the use of estimates and assumptions based on available historical and prospective information, among other factors. For an entity to qualify as a VIE, ASC 810 requires the Company to determine if the Company is the primary beneficiary of the VIE, and, if so, to consolidate such entity into its consolidated financial statements. The Company consolidates VIEs in which it has a controlling financial interest and is therefore deemed the primary beneficiary. A controlling financial interest will have both of the following characteristics: (a) the power to direct the VIE activities that most significantly impact economic performance; and (b) the obligation to absorb the VIE losses and the right to receive benefits that are significant to the VIE. Periodically, the Company reevaluates its ownership, contractual and other interests in entities to determine whether any changes in its interest or relationship with an entity impacts the determination of whether it is still the primary beneficiary of such entity. The Company has determined that it was the primary beneficiary of one VIE as of December 31, 2023.\n\n# Recent Accounting Pronouncements']","The provided 10-K excerpts from Uber and Lyft do not contain information on how the equity method affects net income per share, net operating loss carryforwards, or diluted earnings.

Our business is subject to a variety of U.S. federal, state, local and foreign laws, rules, and regulations, including those related to Internet activities, privacy, cybersecurity, data protection, intellectual property, competition, consumer protection, payments, labor and employment, transportation services, transportation network companies, licensing regulations and taxation. These laws and regulations are constantly evolving and may be interpreted, applied, created, or amended, in a manner that could harm our business. Examples of certain laws and regulations we are subject to are described below. For further discussion of risks relating to government regulation, see our risk factors, including the risk factors in the section titled ""Legal and Regulatory Risks Related to Our Business"" in Part I, Item 1A of this Annual Report on Form 10-K. Our platform, and in particular our Mobility products, are subject to differing, and sometimes conflicting, laws, rules, and regulations in the numerous jurisdictions in which we operate. A large number of proposals are before various national, regional, and local legislative bodies and regulatory entities, both within the United States and in foreign jurisdictions, regarding issues related to our business model. In the United States, many state and local laws, rules, and regulations impose legal restrictions and other requirements on operating our Mobility products, including licensing, insurance, screening, and background check requirements. Outside of the United States, certain jurisdictions have adopted similar laws, rules, and regulations while other jurisdictions have not adopted any laws, rules, and regulations which govern our Mobility business. Further, certain jurisdictions, including Argentina, Germany, Italy, Japan, South Korea, and Spain, six countries that we have identified as expansion markets, have adopted laws, rules, and regulations banning certain ridesharing products or imposing extensive operational restrictions. This uncertainty and fragmented regulatory environment creates significant complexities for our business and operating model. In addition, our Delivery and Freight products are also subject to laws, regulations and standards that govern the transportation of food, alcohol and other goods. Substantially all states in the United States and numerous municipalities in the United States and around the world have adopted Transportation Network Company (""TNC"") regulations. These regulations generally focus on companies that operate websites or mobile apps that connect individual drivers with their own vehicles to passengers willing to pay to be driven to their destinations. These regulations often require TNCs to comply with rules regarding, among other things, background checks, vehicle inspections, accessible vehicles, driver and consumer safety, insurance, driver training, driver conduct, and other similar matters.', '# Our Commitment to Safety\n\nHidden contact information and ride history. The Lyft App hides contact information for both the rider and driver before, during and after the ride. While riders and drivers are able to call or text one another through the app, personal information, including real user phone numbers, are not revealed. Drivers are also not able to see a rider\'s drop-off location, whether it\'s a specific address or a cross-street, after the ride is complete. Two-way ratings and feedback. At the end of each trip, drivers and riders are prompted to rate their ride on the scale of one to five stars. Any rider or driver who submits a rating of four stars or fewer is prompted to provide more details. Anyone who rates a rider or driver three stars or fewer will never be matched with that individual again through the app. 9\n\n# Government Regulation\n\nWe are subject to a wide variety of laws and regulations in the United States and other jurisdictions.

As a result, their application in practice may change or develop over time through judicial decisions or as new guidance or interpretations are provided by regulatory and governing bodies, such as federal, state and local administrative agencies. The TNC industry has also come under increasing scrutiny from non-profit organizations, regulators, and legislators for its environmental impact, specifically increasing greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions. In 2018, California passed first-of-its-kind legislation (the ""California Clean Miles Standard"") to mandate that TNCs increase the percentage of zero-emission vehicles on their platforms, with additional requirements to reduce their GHG emissions on a GHG per passenger-mile basis. Policymakers have since passed similar legislation in Massachusetts and New York City to grow EV TNC rides, and may do so in other jurisdictions.

* **Driver and Passenger Safety:** Regulations often mandate background checks for drivers, vehicle inspections, requirements for accessible vehicles, and rules concerning driver and consumer safety.  This directly impacts driver-passenger interactions by aiming to ensure a safer environment.

* **Driver Conduct:**  TNC regulations frequently include stipulations regarding driver conduct, influencing how drivers interact with passengers.  While the specifics aren't detailed in these excerpts, the implication is that regulations aim to set standards for professional and respectful behavior.

* **Insurance:**  The regulations address insurance requirements, which indirectly affect driver-passenger interactions by providing a safety net in case of accidents or incidents during a ride.

* **Other Similar Matters:** The Uber 10-K mentions ""other similar matters"" under TNC regulations, suggesting a broader scope encompassing aspects that may indirectly influence driver-passenger interactions, though the specifics are not provided.

33,How do short-term investments affect credit loss assessment on balance sheets?,"[""# Debt Securities\n\nThe Company's accounting for its investments in debt securities is based on the legal form of the security, the Company's intended holding period for the security, and the nature of the transaction. Investments in debt securities include commercial paper, certificates of deposit, corporate bonds and U.S. government securities. Investments in debt securities are classified as available-for-sale and are recorded at fair value. The Company considers an available-for-sale debt security to be impaired if the fair value of the investment is less than its amortized cost basis. The entire difference between the amortized cost basis and the fair value of the Company's available-for-sale debt securities is recognized on the consolidated statements of operations as an impairment if, (i) the fair value of the security is below its amortized cost and (ii) the Company intends to sell or is more likely than not required to sell the security before recovery of its amortized cost basis. If neither criterion is met, the Company evaluates whether the decline in fair value is due to credit losses or other factors. In making this assessment, the Company considers the extent to which the security's fair value is less than amortized cost, changes to the rating of the security by third-party rating agencies, and adverse conditions specific to the security, among other factors. If the Company's assessment indicates that a credit loss exists, the credit loss is measured based on the Company's best estimate of the cash flows expected to be collected. When developing its estimate of cash flows expected to be collected, the Company considers all available information relevant to the collectability of the security, including past events, current conditions, and reasonable and supportable forecasts. Credit loss impairments are recognized through an allowance for credit losses adjustment to the amortized cost basis of the debt securities on the balance sheet with an offsetting credit loss expense on the consolidated statements of operations. Impairments related to factors other than credit losses are recognized as an adjustment to the amortized cost basis of the security and an offsetting amount in accumulated other comprehensive income (loss), net of tax. As of December 31, 2023, the Company had not recorded any credit impairments. The Company determines realized gains or losses on the sale of debt securities on a specific identification method. The Company's investments in debt securities include: 88 (i) Cash and cash equivalents. Cash equivalents include certificates of deposits, commercial paper and corporate bonds that have an original maturity of 90 days or less and are readily convertible to known amounts of cash. (ii) Short-term investments. Short-term investments are comprised of commercial paper, certificates of deposit, and corporate bonds, which mature in twelve months or less. As a result, the Company classifies these investments as current assets in the accompanying consolidated balance sheets."", '# Allowance for Credit Losses on Available-for-sale Debt Securities\n\nWe account for credit losses on available-for-sale debt securities in accordance with ASC 326, Financial Instruments - Credit Losses (""ASC 326""). Under ASC 326, at each reporting period, we evaluate our available-for-sale debt securities at the individual security level to determine whether there is a decline in the fair value below its amortized cost basis (an impairment). In circumstances 85 where we intend to sell, or are more likely than not required to sell, the security before it recovers its amortized cost basis, the difference between fair value and amortized cost is recognized as a loss in the consolidated statements of operations, with a corresponding write-down of the security\'s amortized cost. In circumstances where neither condition exists, we then evaluate whether a decline is due to credit-related factors. The factors considered in determining whether a credit loss exists can include the extent to which fair value is less than the amortized cost basis, changes in the credit quality of the underlying loan obligors, credit ratings actions, as well as other factors. To determine the portion of a decline in fair value that is credit-related, we compare the present value of the expected cash flows of the security discounted at the security\'s effective interest rate to the amortized cost basis of the security. A credit-related impairment is limited to the difference between fair value and amortized cost, and recognized as an allowance for credit loss on the consolidated balance sheet with a corresponding adjustment to net income (loss). Any remaining decline in fair value that is non-credit related is recognized in other comprehensive income (loss), net of tax. Improvements in expected cash flows due to improvements in credit are recognized through reversal of the credit loss and corresponding reduction in the allowance for credit loss.\n\n## Restricted Investments\n\nAs of December 31, 2023, restricted investments on the consolidated balance sheets are comprised of marketable debt securities that may include U.S. government and agency securities, commercial paper, corporate bonds, and time deposits, which are held in trust accounts at third-party financial institutions pursuant to certain contracts with insurance providers. Restricted investments are classified as non-current assets as these investments are unavailable for use in short-term operations due to legal and/or contractual restrictions.']","Based on the provided 10-K excerpts from Lyft and Uber, short-term investments affect credit loss assessment as follows:

Both companies classify certain short-term investments (e.g., commercial paper, certificates of deposit, corporate bonds with short maturities) as available-for-sale securities.  Credit loss assessment for these securities involves a two-step process:

1. **Impairment Determination:**  The companies first determine if an impairment exists.  This occurs when the fair value of the security falls below its amortized cost.  If the company intends to sell or is more likely than not required to sell the security before recovering its amortized cost, the entire difference is recognized as a loss. If neither condition is met, the company assesses whether the decline is due to credit losses or other factors.  This assessment considers factors like the extent of the fair value decline, changes in credit ratings, and other adverse conditions specific to the security.

2. **Credit Loss Measurement:** If a credit loss is determined to exist, the loss is measured based on the company's best estimate of the expected future cash flows from the security.  This estimate considers all relevant information, including past events, current conditions, and forecasts. The credit loss is then recognized through an allowance for credit losses on the balance sheet, with a corresponding expense on the income statement.  Losses not related to credit are handled differently, being recognized in other comprehensive income.

In short, the presence of short-term investments within the available-for-sale securities portfolio necessitates a careful evaluation of their fair value relative to amortized cost to determine if, and to what extent, credit losses have occurred.  The impact on the balance sheet is reflected in the allowance for credit losses account.  Neither Lyft nor Uber reported any credit impairments related to these investments as of December 31, 2023.

34,What does excess purchase price over net asset value suggest?,"['# Property and Equipment, Net\n\n## Leases\n\nWe account for acquisitions of entities or asset groups that qualify as businesses in accordance with ASC 805, ""Business Combinations” (“ASC 805""). The purchase price of the acquisition is allocated to the tangible and intangible assets acquired and liabilities assumed based on their estimated fair values at the acquisition date. The excess of the purchase price over those fair values is recorded as goodwill. During the measurement period, which may be up to one year from the acquisition date, we may record adjustments to the assets acquired and liabilities assumed with the corresponding offset to goodwill. Upon the conclusion of the measurement period or final determination of the values of assets acquired or liabilities assumed, whichever comes first, any 84 subsequent adjustments are recorded in the consolidated statements of operations. Refer to Note 17 - Business Combinations for further information.\n\n# Goodwill\n\nGoodwill represents the excess of the purchase price over the fair value of net assets acquired in a business combination and is allocated to reporting units expected to benefit from the business combination. We test goodwill for impairment at least annually, in the fourth quarter, or whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that goodwill might be impaired. We evaluate our reporting units when changes in our operating structure occur, and if necessary, reassign goodwill using a relative fair value allocation approach. In testing for goodwill impairment, we first assess qualitative factors to determine whether the existence of events or circumstances leads to a determination that it is more likely than not that the fair value of a reporting unit is less than its carrying amount. If, after assessing the totality of events or circumstances, we determine it is not more likely than not that the fair value of a reporting unit is less than its carrying amount, then additional impairment testing is not required. However, if we conclude otherwise, we proceed to the quantitative assessment. The quantitative assessment compares the estimated fair value of a reporting unit to its book value, including goodwill. If the fair value exceeds book value, goodwill is considered not to be impaired and no additional steps are necessary. However, if the book value of a reporting unit exceeds its fair value, an impairment loss will be recognized in an amount equal to that excess, limited to the total amount of goodwill allocated to that reporting unit. Refer to Note 7 – Goodwill and Intangible Assets for further information.\n\n# Intangible Assets, Net\n\nIntangible assets are carried at cost and amortized on a straight-line basis over their estimated useful lives, which range from two to 18 years. We review definite-lived intangible assets for impairment under the long-lived asset model described in the Evaluation of Long-Lived Assets for Impairment section. Refer to Note 7 - Goodwill and Intangible Assets for further information.\n\n## Investments', ""# Goodwill and Intangible Assets\n\nGoodwill represents the excess of the purchase price over the fair value of the net tangible and identifiable intangible assets acquired in a business combination. Intangible assets resulting from the acquisition of entities are accounted for using the purchase method of accounting based on management's estimate of the fair value of assets received. Intangible assets are amortized on a straight-line basis over the estimated useful lives which range from two to twelve years. Goodwill is not subject to amortization, but is tested for impairment on an annual basis during the fourth quarter or whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate the carrying value of the reporting unit may be in excess of its fair value. As part of the annual goodwill impairment test, the Company first performs a qualitative assessment to determine whether further impairment testing is necessary. If, as a result of its qualitative assessment, it is more- likely-than-not that the fair value of the Company's reporting unit is less than its carrying amount, the quantitative impairment test will be required. Alternatively, the Company may bypass the qualitative assessment and perform a quantitative impairment test. There was no impairment of goodwill recorded for the years ended December 31, 2023, 2022 and 2021.\n\n# Impairment of Long-Lived Assets\n\nThe Company reviews long-lived assets, including property and equipment and intangible assets, for impairment whenever events or changes in business circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of the assets may not be fully recoverable. Such events and changes may include: significant changes in performance relative to expected operating results, changes in asset use, negative industry or economic trends, and changes in the Company's business strategy. The Company measures recoverability of these assets by comparing the carrying amounts to the future undiscounted cash flows that the assets or the asset group are expected to generate. If the carrying value of the assets are not recoverable, the impairment recognized is measured as the amount by which the carrying value of the asset exceeds its fair value. With the exception of impairment charges related to real estate operating right-of-use assets discussed above, there was no other material impairment of long-lived assets recorded for the years ended December 31, 2023, 2022 and 2021.\n\n# Software Development Costs\n\nThe Company incurs costs related to developing the Lyft Platform and related support systems. The Company capitalizes development costs related to the Lyft Platform and related support systems once the preliminary project stage is complete and it is probable that the project will be completed and the software will be used to perform the function intended. The Company has capitalized software development costs of $8.1 million, $12.1 million, and $16.2 million as of the years ended December 31, 2023, 2022, and 2021, respectively.""]","Excess purchase price over net asset value in a business combination is recorded as goodwill.  This means the acquiring company paid more for the acquired business than the fair market value of its identifiable net assets (assets minus liabilities).  The difference reflects the value of intangible assets, such as brand recognition, customer relationships, or superior management, that are not separately identifiable on the balance sheet.  The goodwill is then tested for impairment at least annually to determine if its value has decreased.

35,What might slow efficiencies after an acquisition?,"['# If we are unable to make acquisitions and investments, or successfully integrate them into our business, or if we enter into strategic transactions that do not achieve our objectives, our business, results of operations and financial condition could be adversely affected.\n\nAs part of our business strategy, we will continue to consider a wide array of potential strategic transactions, including acquisitions of businesses, new technologies, services and other assets, joint ventures and strategic investments that complement our business, such as our acquisition of PBSC in May 2022, as well as divestitures, partnerships and other transactions. We have previously acquired and invested in, and we continue to seek to acquire and invest in businesses, technologies, or other assets that we believe could complement or expand our business, including acquisitions of new lines of business and other opportunities that operate in relatively nascent markets. We also may explore investments in new technologies, which we may develop or other parties may develop. The identification, evaluation, and negotiation of potential acquisition or strategic investment transactions may divert the attention of management and entail various expenses, whether or not such transactions are ultimately completed. There can be no assurance that we will be successful in identifying, negotiating, and consummating favorable transaction opportunities. These transactions involve numerous risks, whether or not completed, any of which could harm our business and negatively affect our financial condition and results of operations, including: intense competition for suitable acquisition and investment targets, which could increase transaction costs and adversely affect our ability to consummate deals on favorable or acceptable terms; • failure or material delay in closing a transaction; • transaction-related lawsuits or claims; • our ability to successfully obtain indemnification or representation and warranty insurance; difficulties in integrating the technologies, operations, existing contracts and personnel of an acquired company; • challenges related to entering into new markets or geographies; • difficulties in retaining key employees or business partners of an acquired company; • diversion of financial and management resources from existing operations or alternative acquisition opportunities; • failure to realize the anticipated benefits or synergies of a transaction; failure to identify the problems, liabilities or other shortcomings or challenges of an acquired company or technology, including issues related to intellectual property, regulatory compliance practices, litigation, revenue recognition or other accounting practices, or employee or user issues; • acquired businesses or businesses that we invest in may not have adequate controls, processes, and procedures to ensure compliance with laws and regulations, including with respect to data privacy, data protection, and data security, as well as anti-bribery and anti-corruption laws, export controls, sanctions and industry-specific-regulation; • risks that regulatory bodies may enact new laws or promulgate new regulations that are adverse to an acquired company or business, or the risk that we become subject to new or additional regulatory burdens that affect our business in potentially unanticipated and significantly negative ways; • theft of our trade secrets or confidential information that we share with potential acquisition candidates;', ""# If we are unable to successfully identify, acquire and integrate suitable businesses, our operating results and prospects could be harmed, and any businesses we acquire may not perform as expected or be effectively integrated.\n\nAs part of our business strategy, we have entered into, and expect to continue to enter into, agreements to acquire companies, form joint ventures, divest portions or aspects of our business, sell minority stakes in portions or aspects of our business, and acquire complementary companies or technologies. Competition within our industry for acquisitions of businesses, technologies, and assets is intense. As such, even if we are able to identify a target for acquisition, we may not be able to complete the acquisition on commercially reasonable terms, we may not be able to receive approval from the applicable competition authorities, or such target may be acquired by another company, including one of our competitors. Further, negotiations for potential acquisitions or other transactions may result in the diversion of our management's time and significant out-of-pocket costs. We may expend significant cash or incur substantial debt to finance such acquisitions, and such indebtedness may restrict our business or require the use of available cash to make interest and principal payments. In addition, we may finance or otherwise complete acquisitions by issuing equity or convertible debt securities, which may result in dilution to our stockholders, or if such convertible debt securities are not converted, significant cash outlays. If we fail to evaluate and execute acquisitions or other strategic transactions successfully or fail to successfully address any of these risks, our business, financial condition, and operating results may be harmed. In addition, any businesses we acquire may not perform as well as we expect. Failure to manage and successfully integrate acquired businesses and technologies, including managing internal controls and any privacy, data security or Al risks associated with such acquisitions, may harm our operating results and expansion prospects. For example, Careem has historically shared certain user data with certain government authorities, which conflicts with our global policies regarding data use, sharing, and ownership. We have maintained our data use, sharing, and ownership practices for both our business and Careem's business, and doing so may cause our relationships with government authorities in certain jurisdictions to suffer, and may result in such government authorities assessing fines or penalties against us. The process of integrating an acquired company, business, or technology or acquired personnel into our company is subject to various risks and challenges, including: diverting management time and focus from operating our business to acquisition integration; disrupting our ongoing business operations; platform user acceptance of the acquired company's offerings; implementing or remediating the controls, procedures, and policies of the acquired company; integrating the acquired business onto our systems and ensuring the acquired business meets our financial reporting requirements and timelines;""]","Based on the provided 10-K excerpts from Lyft and Uber, several factors can slow efficiencies after an acquisition:

**Integration Challenges:** Both Lyft and Uber highlight difficulties in integrating the acquired company's technologies, operations, existing contracts, and personnel.  This includes challenges related to:

* **Technology Integration:**  Merging different systems and ensuring compatibility can be complex and time-consuming.
* **Operational Integration:** Aligning different operational processes and workflows can lead to inefficiencies and delays.
* **Contractual Issues:**  Managing and integrating existing contracts from the acquired company can be challenging.
* **Personnel Integration:** Retaining key employees and successfully integrating new employees into the existing workforce can be difficult.  This includes potential issues with employee morale and productivity during the transition.

**Financial and Management Resource Diversion:** Both companies mention that the acquisition process itself, including identification, evaluation, and negotiation, diverts management's attention and resources from existing operations.  This can negatively impact the efficiency of the core business.  Furthermore, financing acquisitions through debt or equity can strain resources and potentially restrict future business activities.

**Unforeseen Issues and Risks:**  Both documents emphasize the risk of failing to identify problems, liabilities, or shortcomings of the acquired company before or during the integration process.  These could include:

* **Intellectual Property Issues:**  Potential conflicts or inadequacies in intellectual property rights.
* **Regulatory Compliance:**  Non-compliance with laws and regulations, particularly concerning data privacy, data security, and anti-corruption measures.
* **Accounting Practices:** Discrepancies or inconsistencies in accounting practices.
* **Employee or User Issues:**  Problems related to employee relations or user acceptance of the acquired company's offerings.

**Failure to Realize Synergies:**  Both companies acknowledge the risk that the anticipated benefits or synergies from the acquisition may not materialize as expected. This could be due to integration challenges, unforeseen market changes, or inaccurate initial assessments of the target company's value.

**Competition and Market Risks:** Uber specifically mentions the intense competition for suitable acquisition targets, which can drive up costs and make it difficult to secure favorable terms.  The risk of regulatory hurdles or the target being acquired by a competitor is also highlighted.


In summary, post-acquisition inefficiencies stem from a combination of integration complexities, resource allocation issues, unforeseen risks associated with the acquired company, and the failure to achieve expected synergies.  The documents emphasize the importance of thorough due diligence and a well-planned integration strategy to mitigate these risks.
","Efficiencies after an acquisition may be slowed by the implementation of integration structures that do not fully integrate an acquired company’s operating functions, which could delay the expected efficiencies and potentially impact the brand and reputation due to any damage or reputational harm to the acquired company’s brand.",0.2202586866145047,0.9073609662647746,0.99999999995,1.0,0.9038461538461539
36,How does the equity method affect diluted net income per share?,"['# Note 12 - Net Income (Loss) Per Share\n\nBasic net income (loss) per share is computed by dividing net income (loss) by the weighted-average number of common shares outstanding for the periods presented. Diluted net income (loss) per share is computed by giving effect to all potential weighted average dilutive common stock. For diluted net income (loss) per share, the dilutive effect of outstanding awards is reflected by application of the treasury stock method and convertible securities by application of the if- converted method, as applicable. We take into account the effect on consolidated net income (loss) per share of dilutive securities of entities in which we hold equity interests that are accounted for using the equity method. 118 The following table sets forth the computation of basic and diluted net income (loss) per share attributable to common stockholders (in millions, except share amounts which are reflected in thousands, and per share amounts):', '# Net Loss Per Share\n\nThe Company follows the two-class method when computing net loss per common share when shares are issued that meet the definition of participating securities. The two-class method determines net loss per common share for each class of common stock and participating securities according to dividends declared or accumulated and participation rights in undistributed earnings. The two-class method requires income available to common stockholders for the period to be allocated between common stock and participating securities based upon their respective rights to receive dividends as if all income for the period had been distributed. The Company had no participating securities outstanding during any of the periods presented. Basic net loss per share is computed by dividing the net loss by the weighted-average number of shares of common stock outstanding during the period. The diluted net loss per share is computed by giving effect to all potentially dilutive securities outstanding for the period. For periods in which the Company reports net losses, diluted net loss per common share attributable to common stockholders is the same as basic net loss per common share attributable to common stockholders, because potentially dilutive common shares are not assumed to have been issued if their effect is anti-dilutive. 92\n\n# Variable Interest Entities\n\nIn accordance with Accounting Standards Codification Topic 810, Consolidation (""ASC 810""), the Company evaluates its ownership, contractual and other interests in entities to assess whether it has a variable interest in entities in which it has a financial relationship and, if so, whether or not those entities are variable interest entities (""VIEs""). These evaluations are complex, involving judgment and the use of estimates and assumptions based on available historical and prospective information, among other factors. For an entity to qualify as a VIE, ASC 810 requires the Company to determine if the Company is the primary beneficiary of the VIE, and, if so, to consolidate such entity into its consolidated financial statements. The Company consolidates VIEs in which it has a controlling financial interest and is therefore deemed the primary beneficiary. A controlling financial interest will have both of the following characteristics: (a) the power to direct the VIE activities that most significantly impact economic performance; and (b) the obligation to absorb the VIE losses and the right to receive benefits that are significant to the VIE. Periodically, the Company reevaluates its ownership, contractual and other interests in entities to determine whether any changes in its interest or relationship with an entity impacts the determination of whether it is still the primary beneficiary of such entity. The Company has determined that it was the primary beneficiary of one VIE as of December 31, 2023.\n\n# Recent Accounting Pronouncements']","Based on the provided Uber 10-K excerpt (Note 12 - Net Income (Loss) Per Share), the equity method affects diluted net income per share by including the effect on consolidated net income (loss) per share of dilutive securities from entities where Uber holds equity interests accounted for using the equity method.

We are subject to the FCPA and other similar laws outside the United States that prohibit improper payments or offers of payments to foreign officials, foreign political parties or candidates for foreign political office for the purpose of obtaining or retaining business. U.S. and non-U.S. regulators alike continue to focus on the enforcement of these laws, and we may be subject to additional compliance requirements to identify criminal activity and payments to sanctioned parties. Our activities in certain countries with high levels of corruption enhance the risk of unauthorized payments or offers of payments by Drivers, consumers, merchants, Shippers or Carriers, employees, consultants, or business partners in violation of various anti-corruption laws, including the FCPA, even though the actions of these parties are often outside our control. Our acquisition of Careem may further enhance this risk because users of Careem's platform and Careem's employees, consultants, and business partners may not be familiar with, and may not have been previously subject to, these anti-corruption laws. In addition, our existing and future safeguards, including training and compliance programs to discourage these practices by such parties, may not prove effective, and such parties may engage in conduct for which we could be held responsible. Additional compliance requirements may compel us to revise or expand our compliance program, including the procedures we use to verify the identity of platform users and monitor international and domestic transactions.""]","Based on Uber's 2023 10-K report, operating in high-corruption areas presents several anti-corruption law risks:

* **Increased risk of unauthorized payments:**  The report explicitly states that operations in high-corruption countries increase the risk of unauthorized payments or offers of payments by various parties (Drivers, consumers, merchants, etc.) violating anti-corruption laws like the FCPA.  This risk is exacerbated by the acquisition of Careem, as their users and partners may be unfamiliar with these laws.

* **Potential liability for third-party actions:** Even if the actions of Drivers, consumers, merchants, employees, consultants, or business partners are outside Uber's direct control, the company could still be held responsible for violations.

* **Ineffective compliance programs:**  The report acknowledges that existing and future safeguards, including training and compliance programs, may not be entirely effective in preventing these violations.

* **Increased regulatory scrutiny and compliance costs:**  The report notes that regulators are focusing on enforcing anti-corruption laws, leading to potential additional compliance requirements and the need to revise or expand existing compliance programs (including user identity verification and transaction monitoring).

38,What might be at risk with weak IP protection?,"['# Failure to protect or enforce our intellectual property rights could harm our business, financial condition and results of operations.\n\nOur success is dependent in part upon protecting our intellectual property rights and technology (such as code, information, data, processes and other forms of information, knowhow and technology), or “intellectual property,"" and as we grow, we expect to continue to develop intellectual property that is important for our existing or future business. We rely on a combination of patents, copyrights, trademarks, service marks, trade dress, trade secret laws and contractual restrictions to establish and protect our intellectual property. However, the steps we take to protect our intellectual property may not be sufficient or effective, and may vary by jurisdiction. Even if we do detect violations, we may need to engage in litigation to enforce our rights. Any enforcement efforts we undertake, including litigation, could be time-consuming and expensive and could divert management attention. While we take precautions designed to protect our intellectual property, it may still be possible for competitors and other unauthorized third parties to copy our technology, reverse engineer our data and use our proprietary information to create or enhance competing solutions and services, which could adversely affect our position in our rapidly evolving and highly competitive industry. Some license provisions that protect against unauthorized use, copying, transfer and disclosure of our technology may be unenforceable under the laws of certain jurisdictions and foreign countries. The laws of some countries do not provide the same level of protection of our intellectual property as do the laws of the United States and effective intellectual property protections may not be available or may be limited in foreign countries. Our domestic and international intellectual property protection and enforcement strategy is influenced by many considerations including costs, where we have business operations, where we might have business operations in the future, legal protections available in a specific jurisdiction, and/or other strategic considerations. As such, we do not have identical or analogous intellectual property protection in all jurisdictions, which could risk freedom to operate in certain jurisdictions if we were to expand. As we expand our international activities, our exposure to unauthorized use, copying, transfer and disclosure of proprietary information will likely increase. We may need to expend additional resources to protect, enforce or defend our intellectual property rights domestically or internationally, which could impair our business or adversely affect our domestic or international operations. We enter into confidentiality and invention assignment agreements with our employees and consultants and enter into confidentiality agreements with our third-party providers and strategic partners. We cannot assure you that these agreements will be effective in controlling access to, and use and distribution of, our platform and proprietary information.', ""# If we are unable to protect our intellectual property, or if third parties are successful in claiming that we are misappropriating the intellectual property of others, we may incur significant expense and our business may be adversely affected.\n\nOur intellectual property includes the content of our website, mobile applications, registered domain names, software code, firmware, hardware and hardware designs, registered and unregistered trademarks, trademark applications, copyrights, trade secrets, inventions (whether or not patentable), patents, and patent applications. We believe that our intellectual property is essential to our business and affords us a competitive advantage in the markets in which we operate. If we do not adequately protect our intellectual property, our brand and reputation may be harmed, Drivers, consumers, merchants, Shippers, and Carriers could devalue our products and offerings, and our ability to compete effectively may be impaired. 41 To protect our intellectual property, we rely on a combination of copyright, trademark, patent, and trade secret laws, contractual provisions, end-user policies, and disclosure restrictions. Upon discovery of potential infringement of our intellectual property, we assess and when necessary, take action to protect our rights as appropriate. We also enter into confidentiality agreements and invention assignment agreements with our employees and consultants and seek to control access to, and distribution of, our proprietary information in a commercially prudent manner. The efforts we have taken and may take to protect our intellectual property may not be sufficient or effective. For example, effective intellectual property protection may not be available in every country in which we currently or in the future will operate. In addition, it may be possible for other parties to copy or reverse-engineer our products and offerings or obtain and use the content of our website without authorization. Further, we may be unable to prevent competitors or other third parties from acquiring or using domain names or trademarks that are similar to, infringe upon, or diminish the value of our domain names, trademarks, service marks, and other proprietary rights. Moreover, our trade secrets may be compromised by third parties or our employees, which would cause us to lose the competitive advantage derived from the compromised trade secrets. Further, we may be unable to detect infringement of our intellectual property rights, and even if we detect such violations and decide to enforce our intellectual property rights, we may not be successful, and may incur significant expenses, in such efforts. In addition, any such enforcement efforts may be time-consuming and may divert management's attention. Further, such enforcement efforts may result in a ruling that our intellectual property rights are unenforceable or invalid. Any failure to protect or any loss of our intellectual property may have an adverse effect on our ability to compete and may adversely affect our business, financial condition, or operating results.""]","Based on the provided 10-K excerpts from Lyft and Uber, weak intellectual property (IP) protection poses several risks:

**Financial and Competitive Risks:**

* **Loss of Competitive Advantage:** Competitors could copy technology, reverse-engineer data, and use proprietary information to create competing solutions, harming market position (Lyft, Uber).  This is especially impactful in rapidly evolving, competitive industries.
* **Significant Expenses:**  Protecting and enforcing IP rights can be costly and time-consuming, diverting management attention and potentially impacting profitability (Lyft, Uber). Litigation is a possibility, adding to these costs.
* **Impaired Business Operations:**  The resources needed for IP protection and enforcement could negatively affect domestic and international operations (Lyft).
* **Reduced Brand Value and Reputation:** Inadequate IP protection could damage brand and reputation, leading to decreased customer valuation of products and services (Uber).
* **Inability to Compete Effectively:**  Failure to protect IP could impair the ability to compete effectively (Uber).

**Legal and Operational Risks:**

* **Unenforceable Agreements:**  License provisions protecting against unauthorized use of technology may be unenforceable in certain jurisdictions (Lyft).  Effective IP protection may not be available or may be limited in foreign countries (Lyft).
* **Infringement and Litigation:**  The risk of others claiming IP misappropriation exists, leading to expensive legal battles (Uber).  Even if infringement is detected, successful enforcement is not guaranteed (Uber).  A ruling against the company's IP rights could result in their invalidation (Uber).
* **Compromised Trade Secrets:**  Trade secrets could be compromised by third parties or employees, resulting in a loss of competitive advantage (Uber).
* **Domain Name and Trademark Infringement:** Competitors could acquire or use similar domain names or trademarks, diminishing the value of the company's own (Uber).
* **Increased Risk with International Expansion:**  Expanding internationally increases exposure to unauthorized use and disclosure of proprietary information (Lyft).  The company may not have identical or analogous IP protection in all jurisdictions, risking freedom to operate in certain areas (Lyft).


In summary, weak IP protection exposes both Lyft and Uber to significant financial, legal, and competitive risks, potentially impacting their ability to operate and compete effectively.  The excerpts highlight the challenges of securing and enforcing IP rights globally, particularly in rapidly evolving technological landscapes.

We are subject to litigation relating to various matters including Driver classification, Drivers' tips and taxes, the Americans with Disabilities Act, antitrust, intellectual property infringement, privacy, unfair competition, workplace culture, safety practices, and employment and human resources practices. The results of any such litigation, investigations, and legal proceedings are inherently unpredictable and expensive. Any claims against us, whether meritorious or not, could be time consuming, costly, and harmful to our reputation, and could require significant amounts of management time and corporate resources. If any of these legal proceedings were to be determined adversely to us, or we were to enter into a settlement arrangement, we could be exposed to monetary damages or be forced to change the way in which we operate our business, which could have an adverse effect on our business, financial condition, and operating results. In addition, we regularly include arbitration provisions in our terms of service with end-users. These provisions are intended to streamline the litigation process for all parties involved, as arbitration can in some cases be faster and less costly than litigating disputes in state or federal court. However, arbitration may become more costly for us, or the volume of arbitrations may increase and become burdensome. Further, the use of arbitration provisions may subject us to certain risks to our reputation and brand, as these provisions have been the subject of increasing public scrutiny. To minimize these risks, we have in the past and may in the future 39 voluntarily limit our use of arbitration provisions, or we may be required to do so, in any legal or regulatory proceeding, either of which could increase our litigation costs and exposure in respect of such proceedings. For example, effective May 15, 2018, we ended mandatory arbitration of sexual misconduct claims by platform users and employees. Further, with the potential for conflicting rules regarding the scope and enforceability of arbitration on a state-by-state basis, as well as conflicting rules between state and federal law, some or all of our arbitration provisions could be subject to challenge or may need to be revised to exempt certain categories of protection. If our arbitration agreements were found to be unenforceable, in whole or in part, or specific claims were required to be exempted from arbitration, we could experience an increase in our litigation costs and the time involved in resolving such disputes, and we could face increased exposure to potentially costly lawsuits, each of which could adversely affect our business, financial condition, operating results, and prospects."", '# We are regularly subject to claims, lawsuits, government and regulatory investigations and other proceedings that may adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations.\n\nIn addition, we regularly include arbitration provisions in our Terms of Service with the drivers and riders and other parties on our platform. These provisions are intended to streamline the litigation process for all parties involved, as arbitration can in some cases be faster and less costly than litigating disputes in state or federal court. However, arbitration may become more costly for us or the volume of arbitration may increase and become burdensome, and the use of arbitration provisions may subject us to certain risks to our reputation and brand, as these provisions have been the subject of increasing public scrutiny. In order to minimize these risks to our reputation and brand, we have in the past and may continue to limit our use of arbitration provisions or be required to do so in a legal or regulatory proceeding, either of which could increase our litigation costs and exposure. For example, effective May 2018, we ended mandatory arbitration of sexual misconduct claims by users and employees. Further, with the potential for conflicting rules regarding the scope and enforceability of arbitration on a state-by-state basis, as well as between state and federal law, there is a risk that some or all of our arbitration provisions could be subject to challenge or may need to be revised to exempt certain categories of protection. If our arbitration agreements were found to be unenforceable, in 42 whole or in part, or specific claims are required to be exempted from arbitration, we could experience an increase in our costs to litigate disputes and the time involved in resolving such disputes, and we could face increased exposure to potentially costly lawsuits, each of which could adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations. As we expand our offerings, we may become subject to additional laws and regulations, and any actual or perceived failure by us to comply with such laws and regulations or manage the increased costs associated with such laws and regulations could adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations. As we continue to expand our offerings and user base, we may become subject to additional laws and regulations, which may differ or conflict from one jurisdiction to another. Many of these laws and regulations were adopted prior to the advent of our industry and related technologies and, as a result, do not contemplate or address the unique issues faced by our industry.']","Both Uber (2023 10-K) and Lyft (2023 10-K)  report that the use of arbitration provisions in their terms of service, while intended to streamline litigation, presents reputational risks due to increasing public scrutiny.  The documents highlight that these provisions have become a subject of increasing public concern.  Further, the potential for conflicting legal interpretations across states and between state and federal law creates a risk that these arbitration agreements could be challenged, deemed unenforceable, or require revisions.  This could lead to increased litigation costs and exposure to potentially costly lawsuits, negatively impacting their reputation and brand.

41,What perks do Uber One members get for rides and delivery?,"['# PART I\n\n## Our Platform\n\nWith our platform, we are making it even easier for our consumers to unlock convenience. In 2020, we rolled out our ""Super App"" view on iOS and Android, which combines our multiple offerings into a single app and is designed to remove friction for our consumers. During November 2021, we launched Uber One in the United States as our single cross-platform membership program that brings together the best of Uber. Uber One members have access to discounts, special pricing, priority service, and exclusive perks across our rides, delivery and grocery offerings. Since then, we have expanded Uber One to approximately 25 countries. Our Eats Pass membership program continues to remain available in select cities as a subscription offering. Our membership programs are designed to make utilizing our suite of products a seamless and rewarding experience for our consumers. We exited 2023 with 19 million members for our Uber One, Eats Pass and Rides Pass membership programs. We are also utilizing our data and scale to offer marketplace-centric advertising to connect merchants and brands with our platform network and unlocking cross-platform advertising formats. During October 2022, we officially launched Uber\'s advertising division and introduced Uber Journey Ads, an engaging way for brands to connect with consumers throughout the entire ride process. We now offer a model that enables brands to partner with Uber on a variety of advertising options on the Uber and Uber Eats apps, and beyond, while connecting with consumers in brand-safe and captivating ways. We also provide comprehensive reporting and analysis, which helps brands fine-tune their understanding of consumers and create more impactful campaigns as they connect with consumers at relevant points throughout their journeys and transactions. During the fourth quarter of 2023, active advertising merchants exceeded 550,000. We believe that our advertising further strengthens the power of our platform and will continue to do so as we onboard more advertisers.', '# Riders\n\nFlexibility. We offer drivers the flexibility to generate income on their own schedule, so they can best prioritize what is important in their lives. Technology. Our predictive technology around ride volume and demand enables us to share key information with drivers about when and where to drive to maximize their earnings on a real-time basis. Transparent and Consistent Pay: We\'ve released multiple products over the years such as upfront pay where drivers can see ride information and what they\'ll earn before accepting a ride. We also launched the Weekly Pay Statement for a clearer, more comprehensive view of driver\'s pay details. Insurance. We procure insurance that helps protect transportation network company (""TNC"") drivers against financial losses related to automobile accidents while on the platform. Community Standards. To help us uphold high community standards, we give both drivers and riders the opportunity to rate each other after a ride booked through the Lyft App. Support. We offer drivers access to 24/7 support and earnings tools as well as education resources and other support to meet their personal goals. Riders are as diverse and dynamic as the communities we serve. They represent all adult age groups and backgrounds and use Lyft to commute to and from work, explore their cities, spend more time at local businesses and stay out longer knowing they can get a reliable ride home. Unless otherwise stated, riders are passengers who request rides from drivers in our ridesharing marketplace and renters of a shared bike, scooter or automobile available on the Lyft App. We work hard to provide riders with a quality experience every time they open the Lyft App, in order to earn the right to have Lyft be their transportation network of choice. Riders on our platform also have key benefits, which include: • Selection and Convenience. We designed the Lyft App with a focus on simplicity, efficiency and convenience. Our proprietary technology efficiently matches riders with drivers through advanced dispatching algorithms providing faster arrival times, localized pricing and maximum availability. Additional transportation modes, such as Light Vehicles, offer more options for shorter trips. We also continue to launch new features, such as Women+ Connect. The more rides that are taken on our platform, the better we are able to offer riders personalized experiences most suitable to their trip. Availability and Reliability. We strive to ensure that riders can get a ride when they want one. We leverage our proprietary dispatch platform and data to help drivers and riders connect efficiently and reduce wait times. As of November 2023, scheduled rides to the airport are backed by our on-time pickup promise in certain major markets. If a ride is more than ten minutes late for a scheduled pick-up, we will offer up to $100 in Lyft credits to make up for it.']","Based on the provided 10-K reports, only Uber's report mentions details about Uber One membership perks.

42,What exec mgmt & restructuring costs add to G&A?,"[""# Restructuring and Related Charges\n\nCosts associated with management-approved restructuring activities, including reductions in headcount, exiting a market or consolidation of facilities are recognized when they are incurred and may include employee termination benefits, impairment of long-lived assets (including impairment of operating lease right- of-use assets), contract termination costs and accelerated lease cost for right-of-use assets that ceased to be used. We record a liability for employee termination benefits either when it is probable that an employee is entitled to them and the amount of the benefits can be reasonably estimated or when management has communicated the termination plan to employees and all of the following conditions have been met: management, having the authority to approve the action, commits to a plan of termination; the plan identifies the number of employees to be terminated, their job classifications and their locations, and the expected completion date; the plan establishes the terms of the benefit arrangement in sufficient detail to enable employees to determine the type and amount of benefits they will receive if they are involuntarily terminated; and actions required to complete the plan indicate that it is unlikely that significant changes to the plan will be made or that the plan will be withdrawn. We accrue for costs to terminate contracts other than a lease when we terminate the contract in accordance with the contract terms. Costs that will continue to be incurred for the remaining term of a contract that is not a lease, and provide no economic benefits to us are recognized at the cease-use date. Costs associated with lease contracts are accounted for under the leasing accounting guidance or under the long-lived assets accounting guidance. Restructuring and related charges are recognized as an operating expense within the consolidated statements of operations and are classified based on our classification policy for each category of operating expense. Personnel costs are classified based on each employee's classification, lease costs (including impairments of right-of-use assets) are classified in the same expense line item where each lease's rent expense was recognized and impairment of other long-lived assets are recorded within general and administrative expenses.\n\n# Foreign Currency\n\nThe functional currency of our foreign subsidiaries is the local currency or U.S. dollar depending on the nature of the subsidiaries' activities. Monetary assets and liabilities denominated in currencies other than the functional currency are remeasured to the functional currency at the exchange rate in effect at the end of the period. Gains and losses resulting from remeasurement are recorded in foreign exchange gains (losses), net within other income (expense), net in the consolidated statements of operations. Subsidiary assets and liabilities with non-U.S. dollar functional currencies are translated at the month-end rate, retained earnings and other equity items are translated at historical rates, and revenues and expenses are translated at average exchange rates during the year. Cumulative translation adjustments are recorded within accumulated other comprehensive income (loss), a separate component of total equity (deficit)."", '# Reconciliation of Non-GAAP Financial Measures\n\nIncludes third-party costs incurred related to our acquisition of PBSC in the second quarter of 2022 and our transaction with Woven Planet in the second quarter of 2021.
