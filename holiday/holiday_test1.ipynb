      "{'response': AIMessage(content=\"Jurisdictions can pose significant challenges to business operations, particularly in the context of regulatory compliance. Based on the 10-K reports of Uber and Lyft, the following challenges are evident:\\n\\n1. **Operational Limitations**: Companies may face restrictions in providing or operating their products and services in certain jurisdictions. For instance, Uber's report mentions that they may be blocked or limited in certain areas, necessitating modifications to their business model to comply with local regulations (Uber 10-K, page 12).\\n\\n2. **Extensive Regulation**: Both companies are subject to extensive government regulation and oversight, particularly concerning payment and financial services. This regulation can complicate operations and may restrict growth opportunities or lead to increased costs associated with compliance (Uber 10-K, page 37; Lyft 10-K, page 42).\\n\\n3. **Diverse and Conflicting Regulations**: As businesses expand their offerings, they may encounter a patchwork of laws and regulations that differ significantly from one jurisdiction to another. This situation can create compliance challenges and may require businesses to adapt their operations to align with varying legal requirements (Lyft 10-K, page 42).\\n\\n4. **Potential for Increased Scrutiny**: Regulatory authorities may impose additional laws that may not have been anticipated when the original regulations were created, particularly given the rapid evolution of technology in the industry. This can lead to uncertainty and the need for constant monitoring and adaptation to remain compliant (Lyft 10-K, page 42).\\n\\nThese challenges underscore the importance of regulatory compliance for businesses operating across multiple jurisdictions, as they can significantly impact operational capabilities and financial performance.\", additional_kwargs={'refusal': None}, response_metadata={'token_usage': {'completion_tokens': 326, 'prompt_tokens': 1828, 'total_tokens': 2154, 'completion_tokens_details': {'accepted_prediction_tokens': 0, 'audio_tokens': 0, 'reasoning_tokens': 0, 'rejected_prediction_tokens': 0}, 'prompt_tokens_details': {'audio_tokens': 0, 'cached_tokens': 0}}, 'model_name': 'gpt-4o-mini-2024-07-18', 'system_fingerprint': 'fp_0aa8d3e20b', 'finish_reason': 'stop', 'logprobs': None}, id='run-af5cb7ca-5d56-4b6d-9a87-23323702c315-0', usage_metadata={'input_tokens': 1828, 'output_tokens': 326, 'total_tokens': 2154}), 'context': [Document(metadata={'source': 'docs/uber.pdf', 'file_path': 'docs/uber.pdf', 'page': 12, 'total_pages': 191, 'format': 'PDF 1.4', 'title': '0001543151-24-000012', 'author': 'EDGAR® Online LLC, a subsidiary of OTC Markets Group', 'subject': 'Form 10-K filed on 2024-02-15 for the period ending 2023-12-31', 'keywords': '0001543151-24-000012; ; 10-K', 'creator': 'EDGAR Filing HTML Converter', 'producer': 'EDGRpdf Service w/ EO.Pdf 22.0.40.0', 'creationDate': \"D:20240215163245-05'00'\", 'modDate': \"D:20240215163307-05'00'\", 'trapped': '', 'encryption': 'Standard V2 R3 128-bit RC4', '_id': 'ce2be2c1f0a34f95abb9d47a7e190a75', '_collection_name': 'holiday-test'}, page_content='•\\nWe may continue to be blocked from or limited in providing or operating our products and offerings in certain jurisdictions, and may be required to\\nmodify our business model in those jurisdictions as a result.\\n•\\nOur business is subject to numerous legal and regulatory risks that could have an adverse impact on our business and future prospects.\\n•\\nOur business is subject to extensive government regulation and oversight relating to the provision of payment and financial services.\\n•'), Document(metadata={'source': 'docs/uber.pdf', 'file_path': 'docs/uber.pdf', 'page': 35, 'total_pages': 191, 'format': 'PDF 1.4', 'title': '0001543151-24-000012', 'author': 'EDGAR® Online LLC, a subsidiary of OTC Markets Group', 'subject': 'Form 10-K filed on 2024-02-15 for the period ending 2023-12-31', 'keywords': '0001543151-24-000012; ; 10-K', 'creator': 'EDGAR Filing HTML Converter', 'producer': 'EDGRpdf Service w/ EO.Pdf 22.0.40.0', 'creationDate': \"D:20240215163245-05'00'\", 'modDate': \"D:20240215163307-05'00'\", 'trapped': '', 'encryption': 'Standard V2 R3 128-bit RC4', '_id': '75800c65eabb4b939527b0015e2c5ddb', '_collection_name': 'holiday-test'}, page_content='business.

      "{'response': AIMessage(content=\"The challenges posed by competition in technology regarding the maintenance of interoperability of platforms, as highlighted in the 10-K reports from Uber and Lyft, include several key factors:\\n\\n1. **Dependence on Third-Party Systems**: Both companies emphasize that their platforms must remain interoperable across various devices and operating systems (e.g., iOS and Android) as well as with third-party applications that they do not control. Any changes in these third-party systems can affect their services. For instance, Uber mentions that its platform's accessibility is contingent on these external systems, which may evolve in ways that are not aligned with their own platform capabilities.\\n\\n2. **Evolving Third-Party Services**: There is a constant evolution of third-party applications and services, which can lead to difficulties in ensuring compatibility. Uber notes that it may not be able to modify its platform quickly enough to maintain compatibility with the rapid changes made by third-party developers.\\n\\n3. **Competitor Actions**: Lyft points out that competitors or technology partners might take actions that disrupt the interoperability of their platform with others, or they may exert influence over the terms of interoperability, which can restrict their business operations and integration capabilities.\\n\\n4. **Technological Changes**: Both companies face challenges related to changes in internet and mobile device technologies, which can impact how their platforms interact with external systems. This includes potential defects or vulnerabilities in their technology or that of third-party providers.\\n\\n5. **Intellectual Property Issues**: The management of intellectual property rights can also pose challenges in ensuring interoperability, as disputes or limitations regarding technology usage can hinder the ability to integrate effectively with other platforms.\\n\\nIn summary, maintaining interoperability in a competitive technology landscape involves navigating the complexities of third-party dependencies, rapid technological changes, competitive disruptions, and intellectual property considerations.

Here are the key points:\\n\\n1. **Jurisdictional Restrictions**: Companies like Uber may face blocking or limitations on providing or operating their products in certain jurisdictions. This may require them to modify their business models to comply with local regulations (Uber, Page 12 and 35).\\n\\n2. **Legal and Regulatory Risks**: Businesses are subject to numerous legal and regulatory risks that could adversely impact their operations and future prospects. These risks can vary significantly across different jurisdictions and may involve compliance with extensive government regulation and oversight, particularly in sectors like payment and financial services (Uber, Page 12 and 37).\\n\\n3. **Varying Regulations**: As companies expand their offerings and user base, they may become subject to additional laws and regulations, which can differ or even conflict from one jurisdiction to another. This is particularly challenging as many existing laws were established before the advent of new industries and technologies, leaving them ill-equipped to address the unique issues faced by modern companies (Lyft, Page 42).\\n\\nThese excerpts highlight that navigating regulatory compliance across multiple jurisdictions requires businesses to be adaptable and often involves significant legal and operational adjustments to meet local legal requirements.\", additional_kwargs={'refusal': None}, response_metadata={'token_usage': {'completion_tokens': 263, 'prompt_tokens': 1830, 'total_tokens': 2093, 'completion_tokens_details': {'accepted_prediction_tokens': 0, 'audio_tokens': 0, 'reasoning_tokens': 0, 'rejected_prediction_tokens': 0}, 'prompt_tokens_details': {'audio_tokens': 0, 'cached_tokens': 0}}, 'model_name': 'gpt-4o-2024-08-06', 'system_fingerprint': 'fp_5f20662549', 'finish_reason': 'stop', 'logprobs': None}, id='run-486e2dc5-f731-42e7-9e3f-0b8efb058e1a-0', usage_metadata={'input_tokens': 1830, 'output_tokens': 263, 'total_tokens': 2093}), 'context': [Document(metadata={'source': 'docs/uber.pdf', 'file_path': 'docs/uber.pdf', 'page': 12, 'total_pages': 191, 'format': 'PDF 1.4', 'title': '0001543151-24-000012', 'author': 'EDGAR® Online LLC, a subsidiary of OTC Markets Group', 'subject': 'Form 10-K filed on 2024-02-15 for the period ending 2023-12-31', 'keywords': '0001543151-24-000012; ; 10-K', 'creator': 'EDGAR Filing HTML Converter', 'producer': 'EDGRpdf Service w/ EO.Pdf 22.0.40.0', 'creationDate': \"D:20240215163245-05'00'\", 'modDate': \"D:20240215163307-05'00'\", 'trapped': '', 'encryption': 'Standard V2 R3 128-bit RC4', '_id': '77515dd7360a4c8b815544bcf18667f2', '_collection_name': 'holiday-test'}, page_content='•\\nWe may continue to be blocked from or limited in providing or operating our products and offerings in certain jurisdictions, and may be required to\\nmodify our business model in those jurisdictions as a result.\\n•\\nOur business is subject to numerous legal and regulatory risks that could have an adverse impact on our business and future prospects.\\n•\\nOur business is subject to extensive government regulation and oversight relating to the provision of payment and financial services.\\n•'), Document(metadata={'source': 'docs/uber.pdf', 'file_path': 'docs/uber.pdf', 'page': 35, 'total_pages': 191, 'format': 'PDF 1.4', 'title': '0001543151-24-000012', 'author': 'EDGAR® Online LLC, a subsidiary of OTC Markets Group', 'subject': 'Form 10-K filed on 2024-02-15 for the period ending 2023-12-31', 'keywords': '0001543151-24-000012; ; 10-K', 'creator': 'EDGAR Filing HTML Converter', 'producer': 'EDGRpdf Service w/ EO.Pdf 22.0.40.0', 'creationDate': \"D:20240215163245-05'00'\", 'modDate': \"D:20240215163307-05'00'\", 'trapped': '', 'encryption': 'Standard V2 R3 128-bit RC4', '_id': '7f9e91f669384c5bbfc03623b6cf767e', '_collection_name': 'holiday-test'}, page_content='business.

For instance, in Lyft's 10K report, rental revenue is reported under ASC 842, while revenue from contracts with customers is reported under ASC 606.

      "What IP risks come from joint dev. agreements and their effect on competition?\n",
      "{'response': AIMessage(content=\"Joint development agreements can pose several intellectual property (IP) risks that may affect a company's competitive position. Based on the information provided from the 10K reports of companies like Lyft and Uber, here are the key risks and their potential impacts on competition:\\n\\n1. **Joint Ownership of IP**: When companies enter into strategic partnerships or joint development agreements, the resulting intellectual property may be jointly owned. This joint ownership can complicate the protection, maintenance, and enforcement of IP rights. For example, decisions regarding the commercialization or defense of the IP might require consensus between partners, potentially leading to delays or disagreements that can weaken the competitive edge.\\n\\n2. **Transfer or Licensing of IP**: Such agreements often involve the transfer or licensing of intellectual property to the counterparty. This can limit a company's control over its IP, reducing its ability to capitalize on the IP independently and potentially diminishing its competitive advantage if the partner also gains significant rights to use or exploit the IP.\\n\\n3. **Impact on Market Value**: Joint development partners may register, maintain, enforce, or license the IP in ways that may not align with the company's strategic interests. This misalignment can devalue the jointly-owned intellectual property, thereby affecting the company's market position.\\n\\n4. **Requirement for Agreement or Payment**: Companies might be required to obtain agreement from or make payments to their joint development partners to protect or commercialize the IP.

The classification as independent contractors versus employees is being contested in courts, with potential adverse outcomes. If drivers are reclassified as employees, it could lead to significant financial, legal, and operational repercussions, including increased costs for wages, benefits, and taxes.\\n   - **Regulatory Scrutiny**: The companies are subject to ongoing legal proceedings, including lawsuits and government investigations, which can create uncertainty and lead to inconsistent regulations across different jurisdictions.\\n\\n2. **Competition**:\\n   - **Market Position**: Both companies operate in highly competitive markets. Increased competition can lead to pricing pressures, reduced market share, and the need for increased spending on marketing and incentives to retain drivers and customers.\\n   - **Innovation and Technology**: Staying ahead in terms of technology and service offerings is crucial. Failure to innovate or adapt to new market trends can negatively impact business growth and customer retention.\\n\\nOverall, the combined challenges of employee classification and competition present significant risks that could affect business stability, financial performance, and operational strategies of companies like Uber and Lyft.\", additional_kwargs={'refusal': None}, response_metadata={'token_usage': {'completion_tokens': 271, 'prompt_tokens': 1832, 'total_tokens': 2103, 'completion_tokens_details': {'accepted_prediction_tokens': 0, 'audio_tokens': 0, 'reasoning_tokens': 0, 'rejected_prediction_tokens': 0}, 'prompt_tokens_details': {'audio_tokens': 0, 'cached_tokens': 0}}, 'model_name': 'gpt-4o-2024-08-06', 'system_fingerprint': 'fp_5f20662549', 'finish_reason': 'stop', 'logprobs': None}, id='run-5e432d02-d21a-42ed-8736-353d6d623127-0', usage_metadata={'input_tokens': 1832, 'output_tokens': 271, 'total_tokens': 2103}), 'context': [Document(metadata={'source': 'docs/uber.pdf', 'file_path': 'docs/uber.pdf', 'page': 12, 'total_pages': 191, 'format': 'PDF 1.4', 'title': '0001543151-24-000012', 'author': 'EDGAR® Online LLC, a subsidiary of OTC Markets Group', 'subject': 'Form 10-K filed on 2024-02-15 for the period ending 2023-12-31', 'keywords': '0001543151-24-000012; ; 10-K', 'creator': 'EDGAR Filing HTML Converter', 'producer': 'EDGRpdf Service w/ EO.Pdf 22.0.40.0', 'creationDate': \"D:20240215163245-05'00'\", 'modDate': \"D:20240215163307-05'00'\", 'trapped': '', 'encryption': 'Standard V2 R3 128-bit RC4', '_id': '299c2542773a4b78a380b68d071bc42a', '_collection_name': 'holiday-test'}, page_content='Operational Risks\\nOur business would be adversely affected if Drivers were classified as employees, workers or quasi-employees.\\nThe classification of Drivers is currently being challenged in courts, by legislators and by government agencies in the United States and abroad.

This can provide a clearer picture of the recurring, core business operating results.\\n\\n3. **Comparability**: These measures facilitate period-to-period comparisons by adjusting for items that can fluctuate significantly over time, thereby providing a more consistent basis for comparison.\\n\\n4. **Supplemental Information**: Non-GAAP measures provide meaningful supplemental information that complements the GAAP financial measures. They should be considered in conjunction with GAAP measures rather than as substitutes.\\n\\n5. **Analyst and Investor Use**: Institutional investors and analysts use these measures to analyze the company's business health, making non-GAAP measures an important tool for external stakeholders as well.\\n\\nOverall, non-GAAP financial measures can be a valuable tool for assessing a company's performance, but they should be used alongside GAAP measures to provide a comprehensive view of the company's financial situation.\", additional_kwargs={'refusal': None}, response_metadata={'token_usage': {'completion_tokens': 303, 'prompt_tokens': 1830, 'total_tokens': 2133, 'completion_tokens_details': {'accepted_prediction_tokens': 0, 'audio_tokens': 0, 'reasoning_tokens': 0, 'rejected_prediction_tokens': 0}, 'prompt_tokens_details': {'audio_tokens': 0, 'cached_tokens': 0}}, 'model_name': 'gpt-4o-2024-08-06', 'system_fingerprint': 'fp_5f20662549', 'finish_reason': 'stop', 'logprobs': None}, id='run-fe60acd1-7107-4111-8c63-dc2c74a6f61f-0', usage_metadata={'input_tokens': 1830, 'output_tokens': 303, 'total_tokens': 2133}), 'context': [Document(metadata={'source': 'docs/uber.pdf', 'file_path': 'docs/uber.pdf', 'page': 61, 'total_pages': 191, 'format': 'PDF 1.4', 'title': '0001543151-24-000012', 'author': 'EDGAR® Online LLC, a subsidiary of OTC Markets Group', 'subject': 'Form 10-K filed on 2024-02-15 for the period ending 2023-12-31', 'keywords': '0001543151-24-000012; ; 10-K', 'creator': 'EDGAR Filing HTML Converter', 'producer': 'EDGRpdf Service w/ EO.Pdf 22.0.40.0', 'creationDate': \"D:20240215163245-05'00'\", 'modDate': \"D:20240215163307-05'00'\", 'trapped': '', 'encryption': 'Standard V2 R3 128-bit RC4', '_id': '456f5073820241f9ab41bb16a579dbd3', '_collection_name': 'holiday-test'}, page_content='We believe that both management and investors benefit from referring to these non-GAAP financial measures in assessing our performance and when\\nplanning, forecasting, and analyzing future periods.

This has led to increased operational oversight and costs associated with maintaining compliance.\\n\\n2. **Business Model Adjustments**: In certain jurisdictions, strict TNC laws have necessitated changes to the ridesharing business model. For example, Uber mentions that in some markets, their business model has been blocked, capped, or suspended, prompting them to seek licenses or permits to continue operations.\\n\\n3. **Market Accessibility**: Lyft indicates that through proactive engagement with regulatory bodies, a significant number of U.S. states have adopted laws addressing the unique issues of the ridesharing sector.

This includes:\\n     - Derivative actions or proceedings brought on behalf of the company.\\n     - Actions asserting a breach of fiduciary duty.\\n     - Actions asserting claims against the company or its directors, officers, or employees arising under the Delaware General Corporation Law.\\n\\n2. **Indemnification**:\\n   - The role of the Delaware Court of Chancery in indemnification matters includes making determinations on indemnification claims. For instance, if an indemnitee is adjudged liable to the company, indemnification for expenses may still be granted if the Chancery Court or another court finds it appropriate, considering all circumstances of the case.\\n\\n3. **Exclusive Forum Provision**:\\n   - The company's amended and restated certificate of incorporation often includes provisions stating that the Court of Chancery of Delaware is the exclusive forum for disputes involving internal corporate affairs, which can limit stockholders' ability to seek judicial forums outside Delaware for disputes with the company or its management.\\n\\nIn summary, the Delaware Court of Chancery serves as a pivotal forum for resolving disputes related to corporate governance and indemnification, ensuring that these cases are handled within Delaware's jurisdiction, which is known for its expertise in corporate law.\", additional_kwargs={'refusal': None}, response_metadata={'token_usage': {'completion_tokens': 317, 'prompt_tokens': 1915, 'total_tokens': 2232, 'completion_tokens_details': {'accepted_prediction_tokens': 0, 'audio_tokens': 0, 'reasoning_tokens': 0, 'rejected_prediction_tokens': 0}, 'prompt_tokens_details': {'audio_tokens': 0, 'cached_tokens': 0}}, 'model_name': 'gpt-4o-2024-08-06', 'system_fingerprint': 'fp_5f20662549', 'finish_reason': 'stop', 'logprobs': None}, id='run-9a1ccce4-f8d1-4287-880c-fb8fc651036f-0', usage_metadata={'input_tokens': 1915, 'output_tokens': 317, 'total_tokens': 2232}), 'context': [Document(metadata={'source': 'docs/uber.pdf', 'file_path': 'docs/uber.pdf', 'page': 45, 'total_pages': 191, 'format': 'PDF 1.4', 'title': '0001543151-24-000012', 'author': 'EDGAR® Online LLC, a subsidiary of OTC Markets Group', 'subject': 'Form 10-K filed on 2024-02-15 for the period ending 2023-12-31', 'keywords': '0001543151-24-000012; ; 10-K', 'creator': 'EDGAR Filing HTML Converter', 'producer': 'EDGRpdf Service w/ EO.Pdf 22.0.40.0', 'creationDate': \"D:20240215163245-05'00'\", 'modDate': \"D:20240215163307-05'00'\", 'trapped': '', 'encryption': 'Standard V2 R3 128-bit RC4', '_id': 'c5e308df90da4f8aa413d932b76b9d6b', '_collection_name': 'holiday-test'}, page_content='Our amended and restated certificate of incorporation provides that the Court of Chancery of the State of Delaware is the exclusive forum for the following\\ntypes of actions or proceedings under Delaware statutory or common law:\\n•\\nany derivative action or proceeding brought on our behalf;\\n•\\nany action asserting a breach of fiduciary duty;\\n•\\nany action asserting a claim against us or our directors, officers, or employees arising under the Delaware General Corporation Law, our amended and'), Document(metadata={'source': 'docs/lyft.pdf', 'file_path': 'docs/lyft.pdf', 'page': 50, 'total_pages': 143, 'format': 'PDF 1.4', 'title': '0001759509-24-000019', 'author': 'EDGAR® Online LLC, a subsidiary of OTC Markets Group', 'subject': 'Form 10-K filed on 2024-02-20 for the period ending 2023-12-31', 'keywords': '0001759509-24-000019; ; 10-K', 'creator': 'EDGAR Filing HTML Converter', 'producer': 'EDGRpdf Service w/ EO.Pdf 22.0.40.0', 'creationDate': \"D:20240220060533-05'00'\", 'modDate': \"D:20240220060544-05'00'\", 'trapped': '', 'encryption': 'Standard V2 R3 128-bit RC4', '_id': 'ec3baaae1d294a45b793b8a62b71f4f1', '_collection_name': 'holiday-test'}, page_content='a claim that is governed by the internal affairs doctrine shall be the Court of Chancery of the State of Delaware (or, if the Court of Chancery does not have\\njurisdiction, another State court in Delaware or the federal district court for the District of Delaware), in all cases subject to the court having jurisdiction over\\nindispensable parties named as defendants.

However, I can provide a general overview based on common knowledge about these regulations:\\n\\n### GDPR (General Data Protection Regulation)\\n- **Notification Requirement**: GDPR requires data controllers to notify the relevant supervisory authority of a data breach within 72 hours of becoming aware of it, unless the breach is unlikely to result in a risk to the rights and freedoms of individuals.\\n- **Affected Individuals**: If the breach is likely to result in a high risk to individuals\\' rights and freedoms, affected individuals must also be informed without undue delay.\\n- **Documentation**: Organizations are obligated to document all data breaches, regardless of whether they are required to notify the supervisory authority.\\n\\n### CCPA (California Consumer Privacy Act)\\n- **Notification Requirement**: CCPA does not specify a particular timeframe for breach notification. However, businesses are generally expected to notify affected California residents \"in the most expedient time possible and without unreasonable delay\" if a breach occurs.\\n- **Private Right of Action**: CCPA provides a private right of action for consumers if their personal information is subject to unauthorized access, theft, or disclosure due to a business’s failure to implement reasonable security procedures.\\n- **Statutory Damages**: Consumers can seek statutory damages ranging from $100 to $750 per incident or actual damages, whichever is greater.\\n\\n### LGPD (Lei Geral de Proteção de Dados)\\n- **Notification Requirement**: The LGPD requires the notification of the national data protection authority and affected individuals within a \"reasonable time period\" in the event of a data breach.\\n- **Content of Notification**: The notification must include a description of the nature of the affected data, information on the data subjects involved, the technical and security measures used to protect the data, risks related to the incident, and measures being taken to address the breach.\\n- **Sanctions**: Non-compliance with LGPD can result in fines of up to 2% of a company’s revenue in Brazil, up to a maximum of 50 million reais per infraction.\\n\\nFor more detailed and specific obligations, it would be necessary to refer directly to the legal texts or professional legal advice, as the provided documents do not contain extensive details on these obligations.', additional_kwargs={'refusal': None}, response_metadata={'token_usage': {'completion_tokens': 466, 'prompt_tokens': 1844, 'total_tokens': 2310, 'completion_tokens_details': {'accepted_prediction_tokens': 0, 'audio_tokens': 0, 'reasoning_tokens': 0, 'rejected_prediction_tokens': 0}, 'prompt_tokens_details': {'audio_tokens': 0, 'cached_tokens': 0}}, 'model_name': 'gpt-4o-2024-08-06', 'system_fingerprint': 'fp_5f20662549', 'finish_reason': 'stop', 'logprobs': None}, id='run-5f0b4e5b-5b04-4ad8-b837-08dcc10528da-0', usage_metadata={'input_tokens': 1844, 'output_tokens': 466, 'total_tokens': 2310}), 'context': [Document(metadata={'source': 'docs/uber.pdf', 'file_path': 'docs/uber.pdf', 'page': 8, 'total_pages': 191, 'format': 'PDF 1.4', 'title': '0001543151-24-000012', 'author': 'EDGAR® Online LLC, a subsidiary of OTC Markets Group', 'subject': 'Form 10-K filed on 2024-02-15 for the period ending 2023-12-31', 'keywords': '0001543151-24-000012; ; 10-K', 'creator': 'EDGAR Filing HTML Converter', 'producer': 'EDGRpdf Service w/ EO.Pdf 22.0.40.0', 'creationDate': \"D:20240215163245-05'00'\", 'modDate': \"D:20240215163307-05'00'\", 'trapped': '', 'encryption': 'Standard V2 R3 128-bit RC4', '_id': '30ffd7a753d44ab9980e5d5c6a89050c', '_collection_name': 'holiday-test'}, page_content='European Union’s General Data Protection Regulation (the “GDPR”), a law which went into effect in May 2018 and implemented more stringent requirements for\\nprocessing personal data relating to individuals in the EU, and the California Consumer Privacy Act (the “CCPA”), which went into effect in January 2020 and\\nestablished new consumer rights and data privacy and protection requirements for covered businesses.

      "{'response': AIMessage(content=\"Deferred tax assets can be influenced by several factors, particularly in the context of tax uncertainties and insurance reserves. Here are some key influences based on the information provided from the documents:\\n\\n1. **Valuation Allowance**: Companies often record a valuation allowance to reduce their deferred tax assets to the amount that is more likely than not to be realized. This involves assessing the company's history of net losses and other factors that might impact realizability (source: Lyft, Page 119).\\n\\n2. **Tax Rate Changes**: Changes in tax rates can affect the values of deferred tax assets. The effect of a change in tax rates is recognized in the period that includes the enactment date, impacting the deferred tax calculations (source: Lyft, Page 86).\\n\\n3. **Stock-Based Compensation**: The amount of stock-based compensation tax deductions available in the future can influence the level of deferred tax assets. This is related to the company's business plans and projections of future taxable income (source: Uber, Page 68).\\n\\n4. **Insurance Reserves and Liabilities**: Companies use a combination of third-party insurance and self-insurance mechanisms to manage insurance reserves.

      "{'response': AIMessage(content=\"Short-term investments, such as available-for-sale debt securities, impact credit loss assessment on balance sheets by requiring companies to evaluate the potential for credit losses on these investments. According to the relevant sections in the 10K reports, companies follow the accounting standards set by ASC 326, Financial Instruments - Credit Losses, to assess and account for credit losses on available-for-sale debt securities.\\n\\nHere are some key points regarding how short-term investments affect credit loss assessment:\\n\\n1. **Classification and Usage**: Short-term investments are often classified as available-for-sale debt securities. These investments are considered available for use in current operations, even if they have maturity dates beyond one year. This classification affects how they are assessed for potential credit losses.\\n\\n2. **Evaluation of Credit Losses**: Companies assess credit losses by estimating the cash flows expected to be collected from these securities. This involves considering past events, current conditions, and reasonable and supportable forecasts relevant to the collectability of the security.\\n\\n3. **Credit Loss Measurement**: If a credit loss is identified, it is measured based on the company's best estimate of the expected cash flows. The assessment includes factors such as the extent to which fair value is less than the amortized cost basis and changes in the credit quality of underlying obligors.\\n\\n4. **Impact on Financial Statements**: The allowance for credit losses on these securities is reflected in the balance sheet, impacting the company's financial position. The assessment and measurement of credit losses ensure that the financial statements accurately represent the potential risk associated with these investments.\\n\\nIn summary, short-term investments require careful assessment for credit losses, impacting the balance sheet's representation of these assets and ensuring compliance with accounting standards like ASC 326.\", additional_kwargs={'refusal': None}, response_metadata={'token_usage': {'completion_tokens': 344, 'prompt_tokens': 1823, 'total_tokens': 2167, 'completion_tokens_details': {'accepted_prediction_tokens': 0, 'audio_tokens': 0, 'reasoning_tokens': 0, 'rejected_prediction_tokens': 0}, 'prompt_tokens_details': {'audio_tokens': 0, 'cached_tokens': 0}}, 'model_name': 'gpt-4o-2024-08-06', 'system_fingerprint': 'fp_5f20662549', 'finish_reason': 'stop', 'logprobs': None}, id='run-5ba8b434-06ec-4b79-85dc-1722610acd00-0', usage_metadata={'input_tokens': 1823, 'output_tokens': 344, 'total_tokens': 2167}), 'context': [Document(metadata={'source': 'docs/uber.pdf', 'file_path': 'docs/uber.pdf', 'page': 86, 'total_pages': 191, 'format': 'PDF 1.4', 'title': '0001543151-24-000012', 'author': 'EDGAR® Online LLC, a subsidiary of OTC Markets Group', 'subject': 'Form 10-K filed on 2024-02-15 for the period ending 2023-12-31', 'keywords': '0001543151-24-000012; ; 10-K', 'creator': 'EDGAR Filing HTML Converter', 'producer': 'EDGRpdf Service w/ EO.Pdf 22.0.40.0', 'creationDate': \"D:20240215163245-05'00'\", 'modDate': \"D:20240215163307-05'00'\", 'trapped': '', 'encryption': 'Standard V2 R3 128-bit RC4', '_id': '6028644ac0eb466c84ffb39ad82e979a', '_collection_name': 'holiday-test'}, page_content='As of December\\xa031, 2023, we considered our marketable debt securities as available for use in current operations, including those with maturity dates beyond\\none year, and therefore classify these securities as short-term investments on the consolidated balance sheets.\\nAllowance for Credit Losses on Available-for-sale Debt Securities\\nWe account for credit losses on available-for-sale debt securities in accordance with ASC 326, Financial Instruments - Credit Losses (“ASC 326”).
