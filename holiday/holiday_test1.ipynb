      "{'response': AIMessage(content=\"In fair value assessments, inputs are categorized within a hierarchical framework, often referred to as levels, to determine the reliability and transparency of the valuation process. Here's how unobservable inputs compare to observable market inputs:\\n\\n1. **Observable Market Inputs (Level 1 and Level 2):**\\n   - **Level 1 Inputs:** These are observable inputs that reflect quoted prices (unadjusted) for identical assets or liabilities in active markets. These inputs are the most reliable and transparent, as they are directly derived from active market data.\\n   - **Level 2 Inputs:** These include inputs other than quoted prices included in Level 1 that are observable for the asset or liability, either directly or indirectly. These might include quoted prices for similar assets or liabilities in active markets, or other observable inputs like interest rates and yield curves.\\n\\n2. **Unobservable Inputs (Level 3):**\\n   - Unobservable inputs are those for which there is little or no market data available, and they are significant to the fair value measurement. They often reflect the company’s own assumptions about what market participants would use in pricing the asset or liability. These inputs are typically used when observable inputs are not available, necessitating the use of internal data and assumptions.\\n   - Unobservable inputs can include factors such as short-term revenue projections, time to liquidity, and volatility, among others. These inputs are inherently more subjective and can lead to greater variability in fair value estimates.\\n\\nThe choice between using observable and unobservable inputs depends largely on the availability of market data and the nature of the asset or liability being valued.

      "{'response': AIMessage(content=\"The risks associated with employee classification and competition can significantly impact business stability, as evidenced by the 10K reports from companies like Uber and Lyft.\\n\\n1. **Employee Classification:**\\n   - **Uber:** The company highlights the risk of drivers being classified as employees, workers, or quasi-employees. Such classification is being challenged in courts, by legislators, and government agencies globally. If drivers were classified as employees, it could adversely affect Uber's business by increasing costs related to employee benefits, taxes, and compliance with labor laws. These changes could lead to operational disruptions and increased financial liabilities (Uber 10K, Page 12).\\n   \\n   - **Lyft:** Similar to Uber, Lyft faces challenges regarding the contractor classification of drivers. These challenges can have adverse business, financial, tax, legal, and other consequences. Ongoing legal proceedings and regulatory scrutiny could create varying or conflicting obligations across different jurisdictions, adding complexity to operations and increasing the risk of penalties or legal costs (Lyft 10K, Pages 37-38).\\n\\n2. **Competition:**\\n   - **Uber and Lyft:** Both companies operate in highly competitive markets. Intense competition could erode market share, pressure margins, and necessitate increased spending on marketing and promotions to maintain or grow their user base. The competitive environment may also drive innovation and technological advancements, requiring continuous investment in technology to stay relevant, potentially impacting profitability.\\n\\nIn summary, challenges in employee classification could lead to increased operational and financial burdens, while competition necessitates ongoing investment and innovation to maintain market position.

      "What is the significance of the debt discount in relation to the 2025 Convertible Notes?\n",
      "{'response': AIMessage(content=\"The significance of the debt discount in relation to the 2025 Convertible Notes primarily involves how it impacts the financial statements and the overall cost of debt for the company. Here's a breakdown based on the information provided:\\n\\n1. **Debt Discount Amortization**: The debt discount represents the difference between the principal amount of the convertible notes and the liability component. For Uber, this difference was $243 million. This amount is amortized to interest expense over the term of the notes using the effective interest method. This amortization increases the reported interest expense in the income statement over the life of the notes.\\n\\n2. **Impact on Balance Sheet**: The liability component of the convertible notes is recorded on the balance sheet, while the equity component, which reflects the conversion option, is included in additional paid-in capital. This arrangement affects the company's leverage ratios and equity structure.\\n\\n3. **Debt Discount and Equity Component**: The debt discount is closely related to the separation of the equity and liability components of the convertible notes. For Lyft, the equity component was $189.2 million, calculated by subtracting the fair value of the liability component from the par value of the notes. The debt discount reflects the lower carrying amount of the liability on the balance sheet compared to the principal amount.\\n\\n4. **Financial Reporting Implications**: The debt discount affects the reported interest expense due to the amortization process, impacting net income and earnings per share calculations. Additionally, the classification of part of the notes as equity can influence the company's financial ratios and metrics used by investors and analysts to assess financial health.\\n\\nOverall, the debt discount is significant because it alters the financial representation of the convertible notes, affects interest expense over time, and influences key financial metrics and ratios.\", additional_kwargs={'refusal': None}, response_metadata={'token_usage': {'completion_tokens': 351, 'prompt_tokens': 2001, 'total_tokens': 2352, 'completion_tokens_details': {'accepted_prediction_tokens': 0, 'audio_tokens': 0, 'reasoning_tokens': 0, 'rejected_prediction_tokens': 0}, 'prompt_tokens_details': {'audio_tokens': 0, 'cached_tokens': 0}}, 'model_name': 'gpt-4o-2024-08-06', 'system_fingerprint': 'fp_5f20662549', 'finish_reason': 'stop', 'logprobs': None}, id='run-11adb2dd-fe17-491c-98a8-ce4a5bad7bd4-0', usage_metadata={'input_tokens': 2001, 'output_tokens': 351, 'total_tokens': 2352, 'input_token_details': {'audio': 0, 'cache_read': 0}, 'output_token_details': {'audio': 0, 'reasoning': 0}}), 'context': [Document(metadata={'source': 'docs\\\\uber.pdf', 'file_path': 'docs\\\\uber.pdf', 'page': 109, 'total_pages': 191, 'format': 'PDF 1.4', 'title': '0001543151-24-000012', 'author': 'EDGAR® Online LLC, a subsidiary of OTC Markets Group', 'subject': 'Form 10-K filed on 2024-02-15 for the period ending 2023-12-31', 'keywords': '0001543151-24-000012; ; 10-K', 'creator': 'EDGAR Filing HTML Converter', 'producer': 'EDGRpdf Service w/ EO.Pdf 22.0.40.0', 'creationDate': \"D:20240215163245-05'00'\", 'modDate': \"D:20240215163307-05'00'\", 'trapped': '', 'encryption': 'Standard V2 R3 128-bit RC4', '_id': '5e1f673a77ff4a84ac9ffaf7536fe9d9', '_collection_name': 'holiday-test'}, page_content='as equity and the liability for the notes themselves.

      "{'response': AIMessage(content=\"The implications of laws regarding cross-border transfers of personal data for businesses operating in multiple jurisdictions are multifaceted and can significantly impact their operations. Based on the provided excerpts from Uber's 10K report, the following points summarize these implications:\\n\\n1. **Regulatory Compliance**: Businesses must navigate a complex and evolving regulatory environment concerning the transfer of personal data across borders. These regulations can include laws related to the European Economic Area (EEA) and similar jurisdictions, which scrutinize and regulate how personal data is transferred and processed.\\n\\n2. **Transfer Mechanisms**: Companies often rely on specific legal mechanisms to transfer personal data internationally. These mechanisms are subject to heightened regulatory and judicial scrutiny, meaning that changes or challenges to these mechanisms can disrupt data transfers.\\n\\n3. **Risk of Penalties**: If businesses cannot rely on existing mechanisms or fail to comply with the local data transfer laws, they may face significant risks. These include potential fines, enforcement actions, litigation, and other penalties, which can be costly and impact their financial condition and operating results.\\n\\n4. **Operational Impact**: Inability to transfer personal data legally could hinder business operations, particularly concerning data related to employees, consumers, and partners in affected regions. This can impact service delivery and the overall business model.\\n\\n5. **Jurisdictional Variability**: Different jurisdictions may have varying requirements concerning data residency and local computation. Changes in these laws can lead to operational challenges, as failure to comply may result in losing the right to operate in those jurisdictions.\\n\\n6. **Strategic Adjustments**: Companies may need to adjust their data management strategies, including investing in local data centers or altering data processing workflows to ensure compliance with local laws.\\n\\nOverall, businesses must stay updated on international data transfer regulations, invest in compliance measures, and be prepared to adapt their operations to mitigate the associated risks and challenges.\", additional_kwargs={'refusal': None}, response_metadata={'token_usage': {'completion_tokens': 374, 'prompt_tokens': 1838, 'total_tokens': 2212, 'completion_tokens_details': {'accepted_prediction_tokens': 0, 'audio_tokens': 0, 'reasoning_tokens': 0, 'rejected_prediction_tokens': 0}, 'prompt_tokens_details': {'audio_tokens': 0, 'cached_tokens': 0}}, 'model_name': 'gpt-4o-2024-08-06', 'system_fingerprint': 'fp_5f20662549', 'finish_reason': 'stop', 'logprobs': None}, id='run-d45c4b17-bc52-496b-855c-00e847e20ee4-0', usage_metadata={'input_tokens': 1838, 'output_tokens': 374, 'total_tokens': 2212, 'input_token_details': {'audio': 0, 'cache_read': 0}, 'output_token_details': {'audio': 0, 'reasoning': 0}}), 'context': [Document(metadata={'source': 'docs\\\\uber.pdf', 'file_path': 'docs\\\\uber.pdf', 'page': 40, 'total_pages': 191, 'format': 'PDF 1.4', 'title': '0001543151-24-000012', 'author': 'EDGAR® Online LLC, a subsidiary of OTC Markets Group', 'subject': 'Form 10-K filed on 2024-02-15 for the period ending 2023-12-31', 'keywords': '0001543151-24-000012; ; 10-K', 'creator': 'EDGAR Filing HTML Converter', 'producer': 'EDGRpdf Service w/ EO.Pdf 22.0.40.0', 'creationDate': \"D:20240215163245-05'00'\", 'modDate': \"D:20240215163307-05'00'\", 'trapped': '', 'encryption': 'Standard V2 R3 128-bit RC4', '_id': '12c08259b8d34378aa738bff9009e7dc', '_collection_name': 'holiday-test'}, page_content='complex, developing regulatory environment.”\\nAdditionally, we are subject to laws, rules, and regulations regarding cross-border transfers of personal data, including laws relating to transfer of personal data\\noutside the EEA.

      "{'response': AIMessage(content='Transportation Network Company (TNC) laws have significantly impacted the ridesharing industry, including companies like Uber and Lyft, by imposing a range of regulatory requirements that have shaped their business models. Below are the key impacts highlighted from the provided documents:\\n\\n1. **Regulatory Compliance**: Both Uber and Lyft have had to comply with various TNC regulations that focus on safety, insurance, and operational standards. These regulations typically mandate background checks, vehicle inspections, accessible vehicles, driver and consumer safety measures, insurance requirements, and driver training. This compliance ensures that ridesharing companies operate within the legal frameworks designed to ensure safety and accountability.\\n\\n2. **Business Model Adaptations**: In some jurisdictions, TNC laws have led to significant changes in the business operations of ridesharing companies. For instance, Uber has faced regulatory challenges in markets such as Argentina, Germany, Italy, Japan, South Korea, and Spain, where their business model has been blocked, capped, or suspended. In response, companies have had to adapt by obtaining licenses or permits and continuously complying with local regulatory requirements.\\n\\n3. **Market Expansion and Limitations**: The introduction of TNC laws has also impacted the geographic expansion strategies of ridesharing companies. While a large majority of U.S. states have adopted laws to support the ridesharing framework, in certain international markets, regulatory restrictions have hindered growth or required significant alterations to the business model.\\n\\nOverall, TNC laws have necessitated a proactive approach by ridesharing companies to engage with regulatory bodies and adapt to evolving legal standards, influencing their operational strategies and market presence.', additional_kwargs={'refusal': None}, response_metadata={'token_usage': {'completion_tokens': 324, 'prompt_tokens': 1844, 'total_tokens': 2168, 'completion_tokens_details': {'accepted_prediction_tokens': 0, 'audio_tokens': 0, 'reasoning_tokens': 0, 'rejected_prediction_tokens': 0}, 'prompt_tokens_details': {'audio_tokens': 0, 'cached_tokens': 0}}, 'model_name': 'gpt-4o-2024-08-06', 'system_fingerprint': 'fp_5f20662549', 'finish_reason': 'stop', 'logprobs': None}, id='run-e4457d8b-9b3b-4cb7-ac1c-7cfc2c5f55f9-0', usage_metadata={'input_tokens': 1844, 'output_tokens': 324, 'total_tokens': 2168, 'input_token_details': {'audio': 0, 'cache_read': 0}, 'output_token_details': {'audio': 0, 'reasoning': 0}}), 'context': [Document(metadata={'source': 'docs\\\\lyft.pdf', 'file_path': 'docs\\\\lyft.pdf', 'page': 37, 'total_pages': 143, 'format': 'PDF 1.4', 'title': '0001759509-24-000019', 'author': 'EDGAR® Online LLC, a subsidiary of OTC Markets Group', 'subject': 'Form 10-K filed on 2024-02-20 for the period ending 2023-12-31', 'keywords': '0001759509-24-000019; ; 10-K', 'creator': 'EDGAR Filing HTML Converter', 'producer': 'EDGRpdf Service w/ EO.Pdf 22.0.40.0', 'creationDate': \"D:20240220060533-05'00'\", 'modDate': \"D:20240220060544-05'00'\", 'trapped': '', 'encryption': 'Standard V2 R3 128-bit RC4', '_id': '7b7527fd44a040f78103c2e65e29ef5d', '_collection_name': 'holiday-test'}, page_content='relationships with drivers or otherwise inhibited the growth of our ridesharing marketplace.

      "What's the Delaware Court of Chancery's role in corporate indemnification and jurisdiction?\n",
      "{'response': AIMessage(content=\"The Delaware Court of Chancery plays a significant role in corporate indemnification and jurisdiction matters for companies incorporated in Delaware. Here are the key points regarding its role based on the provided document excerpts:\\n\\n1. **Corporate Indemnification**: \\n   - The Delaware Court of Chancery is involved in determining indemnification matters. Specifically, if an indemnitee (such as a director or officer) is adjudged liable to the company in a legal proceeding, the Chancery Court (or the court where the proceeding was brought) can determine whether indemnification for expenses is appropriate despite the adjudication of liability, based on the circumstances of the case (Uber 10K, page 176).\\n\\n2. **Jurisdiction for Corporate Disputes**: \\n   - The Court of Chancery is designated as the exclusive forum for certain types of legal actions under Delaware law. These include derivative actions brought on behalf of a company, claims asserting breaches of fiduciary duty, and claims arising under the Delaware General Corporation Law (Uber 10K, page 45).\\n   - Additionally, for claims governed by the internal affairs doctrine, the Court of Chancery is the designated forum, and if it lacks jurisdiction, another state court in Delaware or the federal district court for the District of Delaware may serve as the forum (Lyft 10K, page 50).\\n\\n3. **Exclusive Forum Provisions**: \\n   - Many companies, through their certificates of incorporation and bylaws, establish the Court of Chancery and, in certain cases, federal district courts as the exclusive forums for disputes involving the company and its stakeholders. This can limit stockholders' ability to seek favorable judicial forums outside these designated courts (Uber 10K, page 45).\\n\\nThese points highlight the Delaware Court of Chancery's central role in handling corporate disputes and indemnification issues, reinforcing its importance in the governance of Delaware-incorporated companies.\", additional_kwargs={'refusal': None}, response_metadata={'token_usage': {'completion_tokens': 392, 'prompt_tokens': 1909, 'total_tokens': 2301, 'completion_tokens_details': {'accepted_prediction_tokens': 0, 'audio_tokens': 0, 'reasoning_tokens': 0, 'rejected_prediction_tokens': 0}, 'prompt_tokens_details': {'audio_tokens': 0, 'cached_tokens': 0}}, 'model_name': 'gpt-4o-2024-08-06', 'system_fingerprint': 'fp_5f20662549', 'finish_reason': 'stop', 'logprobs': None}, id='run-26064091-d52e-4b98-9474-aa92cfc9d8ba-0', usage_metadata={'input_tokens': 1909, 'output_tokens': 392, 'total_tokens': 2301, 'input_token_details': {'audio': 0, 'cache_read': 0}, 'output_token_details': {'audio': 0, 'reasoning': 0}}), 'context': [Document(metadata={'source': 'docs\\\\uber.pdf', 'file_path': 'docs\\\\uber.pdf', 'page': 45, 'total_pages': 191, 'format': 'PDF 1.4', 'title': '0001543151-24-000012', 'author': 'EDGAR® Online LLC, a subsidiary of OTC Markets Group', 'subject': 'Form 10-K filed on 2024-02-15 for the period ending 2023-12-31', 'keywords': '0001543151-24-000012; ; 10-K', 'creator': 'EDGAR Filing HTML Converter', 'producer': 'EDGRpdf Service w/ EO.Pdf 22.0.40.0', 'creationDate': \"D:20240215163245-05'00'\", 'modDate': \"D:20240215163307-05'00'\", 'trapped': '', 'encryption': 'Standard V2 R3 128-bit RC4', '_id': 'bbf85ae4fc494c2681bdacb98ea2f99d', '_collection_name': 'holiday-test'}, page_content='Our amended and restated certificate of incorporation provides that the Court of Chancery of the State of Delaware is the exclusive forum for the following\\ntypes of actions or proceedings under Delaware statutory or common law:\\n•\\nany derivative action or proceeding brought on our behalf;\\n•\\nany action asserting a breach of fiduciary duty;\\n•\\nany action asserting a claim against us or our directors, officers, or employees arising under the Delaware General Corporation Law, our amended and'), Document(metadata={'source': 'docs\\\\lyft.pdf', 'file_path': 'docs\\\\lyft.pdf', 'page': 50, 'total_pages': 143, 'format': 'PDF 1.4', 'title': '0001759509-24-000019', 'author': 'EDGAR® Online LLC, a subsidiary of OTC Markets Group', 'subject': 'Form 10-K filed on 2024-02-20 for the period ending 2023-12-31', 'keywords': '0001759509-24-000019; ; 10-K', 'creator': 'EDGAR Filing HTML Converter', 'producer': 'EDGRpdf Service w/ EO.Pdf 22.0.40.0', 'creationDate': \"D:20240220060533-05'00'\", 'modDate': \"D:20240220060544-05'00'\", 'trapped': '', 'encryption': 'Standard V2 R3 128-bit RC4', '_id': '7730545e7a1e4d42ba501dec08f23b55', '_collection_name': 'holiday-test'}, page_content='a claim that is governed by the internal affairs doctrine shall be the Court of Chancery of the State of Delaware (or, if the Court of Chancery does not have\\njurisdiction, another State court in Delaware or the federal district court for the District of Delaware), in all cases subject to the court having jurisdiction over\\nindispensable parties named as defendants.

When tax rates change, the effect on deferred income taxes is recognized in the period that includes the enactment date (source: Lyft, page 86).\\n\\n3. **Tax Deductions**: The availability of future tax deductions, such as those related to stock-based compensation, can also affect the recognition of deferred tax assets (source: Uber, page 68).\\n\\n4. **Insurance Reserves**: Companies use a combination of third-party insurance and self-insurance mechanisms to manage potential liabilities. While these mechanisms can influence overall financial results, their direct impact on deferred tax assets would typically relate to the timing and recognition of deductible expenses related to insurance reserves (source: Uber, page 68; Lyft, page 58).\\n\\n5. **Business Plans and Projections**: Future business plans and projections, including anticipated income and expenses, play a crucial role in determining the extent to which deferred tax assets can be realized.\\n\\nOverall, the factors influencing deferred tax assets include valuation allowances, changes in tax rates, availability of tax deductions, and the management of insurance reserves. These elements are considered in the context of the company's financial projections and historical performance.\", additional_kwargs={'refusal': None}, response_metadata={'token_usage': {'completion_tokens': 353, 'prompt_tokens': 1787, 'total_tokens': 2140, 'completion_tokens_details': {'accepted_prediction_tokens': 0, 'audio_tokens': 0, 'reasoning_tokens': 0, 'rejected_prediction_tokens': 0}, 'prompt_tokens_details': {'audio_tokens': 0, 'cached_tokens': 0}}, 'model_name': 'gpt-4o-2024-08-06', 'system_fingerprint': 'fp_5f20662549', 'finish_reason': 'stop', 'logprobs': None}, id='run-8bc6d1d8-6e4a-4e52-beba-893032713107-0', usage_metadata={'input_tokens': 1787, 'output_tokens': 353, 'total_tokens': 2140, 'input_token_details': {'audio': 0, 'cache_read': 0}, 'output_token_details': {'audio': 0, 'reasoning': 0}}), 'context': [Document(metadata={'source': 'docs\\\\lyft.pdf', 'file_path': 'docs\\\\lyft.pdf', 'page': 118, 'total_pages': 143, 'format': 'PDF 1.4', 'title': '0001759509-24-000019', 'author': 'EDGAR® Online LLC, a subsidiary of OTC Markets Group', 'subject': 'Form 10-K filed on 2024-02-20 for the period ending 2023-12-31', 'keywords': '0001759509-24-000019; ; 10-K', 'creator': 'EDGAR Filing HTML Converter', 'producer': 'EDGRpdf Service w/ EO.Pdf 22.0.40.0', 'creationDate': \"D:20240220060533-05'00'\", 'modDate': \"D:20240220060544-05'00'\", 'trapped': '', 'encryption': 'Standard V2 R3 128-bit RC4', '_id': '443de36554d149579c46265651e1e3a7', '_collection_name': 'holiday-test'}, page_content='the realizability of the deferred tax assets such that a valuation allowance has been recorded.

      "How does the equity method affect net income per share with net operating loss carryforwards and diluted earnings?\n",
      "{'response': AIMessage(content=\"To analyze how the equity method affects net income per share in the context of net operating loss carryforwards and diluted earnings, we must consider several aspects from the provided documents:\\n\\n1. **Equity Method's Impact:**\\n   - The equity method involves recognizing a share of the net income or loss from investments in other entities where the company holds significant influence. This share of income or loss is included in the investor's financial statements, which can affect net income.\\n   - According to the document from Uber's 10-K report, the equity method can influence the consolidated net income (loss) per share by incorporating the results of entities in which the company holds equity interests.\\n\\n2. **Net Operating Loss (NOL) Carryforwards:**\\n   - NOL carryforwards allow a company to apply a net operating loss to future tax periods to reduce taxable income. While this can impact the company's tax liability, it does not directly affect the calculation of net income per share. However, it can influence future profitability and cash flow.\\n\\n3. **Diluted Earnings:**\\n   - Diluted earnings per share (EPS) is computed by considering all potential dilutive securities, such as stock options and convertible securities. This calculation provides a worst-case scenario for EPS, assuming all dilutive instruments are converted into common stock.\\n   - The document from Lyft's 10-K report notes that in periods of net loss, potentially dilutive securities are not included in diluted EPS calculations because their effect would be anti-dilutive.\\n\\nIn summary, the equity method affects net income per share by incorporating the income or loss from equity investments, potentially altering the overall net income figure. NOL carryforwards primarily impact future tax liabilities rather than immediate EPS calculations. Diluted earnings considerations involve adjusting EPS for potential dilution from convertible securities, which can further modify how net income per share is presented if the company is in a profitable state.\", additional_kwargs={'refusal': None}, response_metadata={'token_usage': {'completion_tokens': 385, 'prompt_tokens': 1874, 'total_tokens': 2259, 'completion_tokens_details': {'accepted_prediction_tokens': 0, 'audio_tokens': 0, 'reasoning_tokens': 0, 'rejected_prediction_tokens': 0}, 'prompt_tokens_details': {'audio_tokens': 0, 'cached_tokens': 0}}, 'model_name': 'gpt-4o-2024-08-06', 'system_fingerprint': 'fp_5f20662549', 'finish_reason': 'stop', 'logprobs': None}, id='run-f66ba8c2-40d0-4fe3-9ea2-17dcdceec91f-0', usage_metadata={'input_tokens': 1874, 'output_tokens': 385, 'total_tokens': 2259, 'input_token_details': {'audio': 0, 'cache_read': 0}, 'output_token_details': {'audio': 0, 'reasoning': 0}}), 'context': [Document(metadata={'source': 'docs\\\\uber.pdf', 'file_path': 'docs\\\\uber.pdf', 'page': 119, 'total_pages': 191, 'format': 'PDF 1.4', 'title': '0001543151-24-000012', 'author': 'EDGAR® Online LLC, a subsidiary of OTC Markets Group', 'subject': 'Form 10-K filed on 2024-02-15 for the period ending 2023-12-31', 'keywords': '0001543151-24-000012; ; 10-K', 'creator': 'EDGAR Filing HTML Converter', 'producer': 'EDGRpdf Service w/ EO.Pdf 22.0.40.0', 'creationDate': \"D:20240215163245-05'00'\", 'modDate': \"D:20240215163307-05'00'\", 'trapped': '', 'encryption': 'Standard V2 R3 128-bit RC4', '_id': '63e286fd68724f44ab1ff475f81068da', '_collection_name': 'holiday-test'}, page_content='per share, the dilutive effect of outstanding awards is reflected by application of the treasury stock method and convertible securities by application of the if-\\nconverted method, as applicable.\\nWe take into account the effect on consolidated net income (loss) per share of dilutive securities of entities in which we hold equity interests that are accounted\\nfor using the equity method.\\n118'), Document(metadata={'source': 'docs\\\\uber.pdf', 'file_path': 'docs\\\\uber.pdf', 'page': 119, 'total_pages': 191, 'format': 'PDF 1.4', 'title': '0001543151-24-000012', 'author': 'EDGAR® Online LLC, a subsidiary of OTC Markets Group', 'subject': 'Form 10-K filed on 2024-02-15 for the period ending 2023-12-31', 'keywords': '0001543151-24-000012; ; 10-K', 'creator': 'EDGAR Filing HTML Converter', 'producer': 'EDGRpdf Service w/ EO.Pdf 22.0.40.0', 'creationDate': \"D:20240215163245-05'00'\", 'modDate': \"D:20240215163307-05'00'\", 'trapped': '', 'encryption': 'Standard V2 R3 128-bit RC4', '_id': '8803ac526cb74d6bb8c8941e2f693597', '_collection_name': 'holiday-test'}, page_content='Note 12 – Net Income (Loss) Per Share\\nBasic net income (loss) per share is computed by dividing net income (loss) by the weighted-average number of common shares outstanding for the periods\\npresented.
