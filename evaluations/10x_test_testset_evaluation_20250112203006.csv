1. **Forward-Looking Statements**: Companies include forward-looking statements that relate to potential future events or performance. These statements contain words like ""may,"" ""will,"" ""expect,"" ""plan,"" and ""project,"" indicating uncertainty about actual outcomes. For example, Lyft and Uber each highlight that these statements involve substantial risks and uncertainties, and historical results may not predict future performance.

2. **Management's Discussion and Analysis (MD&A)**: In this section, companies often outline their expectations regarding future operations and financial health. This analysis may include trends, factors affecting performance, and management's strategic plans, all of which offer a forward-looking perspective while acknowledging potential risks.

3. **Risk Factors**: This section enumerates specific risks that could impact future performance, including market risks, regulatory changes, competitive pressures, and operational challenges. For instance, Lyft's report discusses various factors that could lead to actual results differing from estimates.

4. **Objectives and Strategies**: Companies often detail their business strategy and operational goals, which provide context for their expectations. These objectives help readers understand how a company plans to navigate future challenges and achieve performance targets.
