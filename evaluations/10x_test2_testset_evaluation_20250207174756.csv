1,"What is reveune margin, and how does it relate to Lyft's gross bookings?","['# Gross Bookings and Adjusted EBITDA margin (calculated as a percentage of Gross Bookings)\n\nGross Bookings is a key indicator of the scale and impact of our overall platform. We define Gross Bookings as the total dollar value of transactions invoiced to rideshare riders including any applicable taxes, tolls and fees, excluding tips to drivers. Gross Bookings also includes amounts invoiced for other offerings, including but not limited to: Express Drive vehicle rentals, bike and scooter rentals, and amounts recognized for subscriptions, bike and bike station hardware and software sales, media, sponsorships, partnerships, and licensing and data access agreements. Adjusted EBITDA margin (calculated as a percentage of Gross Bookings) is calculated by dividing Adjusted EBITDA for a period by Gross Bookings for the same period. For the definition of Adjusted EBITDA, refer to “Non-GAAP Financial Measures”. The increase in Gross Bookings in the year ended December 31, 2023 as compared to the year ended December 31, 2022 was due primarily to Rides growth which benefited from improvements in marketplace health driven by our competitive pricing adjustments in addition to our focused execution. 56 The improvements in net loss as a percentage of Gross Bookings and Adjusted EBITDA margin (calculated as a percentage of Gross Bookings) in the year ended December 31, 2023 as compared to the year ended December 31, 2022 were due primarily to our cost-restructuring efforts in the first half of the year which helped us to partially offset the impact of competitive pricing to net loss and Adjusted EBITDA. Additionally, our net loss in the year ended December 31, 2022 included a $135.7 million impairment charge related to a non-marketable equity investment in a privately held company and other assets which negatively impacted net loss as a percentage of Gross Bookings in the year ended December 31, 2022, but did not have a similar impact in 2023.', '# We have incurred significant losses since inception, including in the United States and other major markets. We expect our operating expenses to increase in the foreseeable future, and we may not achieve or maintain profitability.\n\nWe have incurred significant losses since inception. We incurred operating losses of $3.8 billion and $1.8 billion in the years ended December 31, 2021 and 2022, respectively, and as of December 31, 2023, we had an accumulated deficit of $30.6 billion. We will need to generate and sustain increased revenue levels and decrease proportionate expenses in future periods to achieve profitability in many of our largest markets, including in the United States, and even if we do, we may not be able to maintain or increase profitability. We may continue to incur losses in the near term as a result of substantial increases in our operating expenses, as we continue to invest in order to: increase the number of Drivers, consumers, merchants, Shippers, and Carriers using our platform through incentives, discounts, and promotions; expand within existing or into new markets; increase our research and development expenses; expand marketing channels and operations; hire additional employees; and add new products and offerings to our platform. These efforts may prove more expensive than we anticipate, and we may not succeed in increasing our revenue sufficiently to offset these expenses. Many of our efforts to generate revenue are new and unproven, and any failure to adequately increase revenue or contain the related costs could prevent us from attaining or increasing profitability. In addition, we sometimes introduce new products that we expect to add value to our overall platform and network but which we expect will generate lower Gross Bookings per Trip or a lower Revenue Margin. Further, we charge a lower service fee to certain of our largest chain restaurant partners on our Delivery offering to grow the number of Delivery consumers, which may at times result in a negative Revenue Margin with respect to those transactions after considering amounts collected from consumers and paid to Drivers. As we expand our offerings to additional cities, our offerings in these cities may be less profitable than the markets in which we currently operate. As such, we may not be able to achieve or maintain profitability in the near term, in accordance with our expectations, or at all. Additionally, we may not realize the operating efficiencies we expect to achieve as a result of our acquisition of Careem, Postmates or other acquired companies, and may continue to incur significant operating losses in the United States, Middle East, North Africa, and Pakistan in the future. Even if we do experience operating efficiencies, our operating results may not improve, at least in the near term. If we are unable to attract or maintain a sufficient number of Drivers, consumers, merchants, Shippers, and Carriers, whether as a result of competition or other factors, our platform will become less appealing to platform users, and our financial results would be adversely impacted.']","Based on the provided documents, ""revenue margin"" is not explicitly defined. However, the Uber 10K report for 2023 mentions ""Revenue Margin"" in the context of their Delivery offering, where they charge a lower service fee to certain large chain restaurant partners. This may result in a negative Revenue Margin after considering amounts collected from consumers and paid to drivers.

The Lyft 10K report for 2023 does not mention ""revenue margin."" Instead, it discusses ""Adjusted EBITDA margin (calculated as a percentage of Gross Bookings)"".

Lyft defines Gross Bookings as the total dollar value of transactions invoiced to rideshare riders, including taxes, tolls, and fees (excluding tips). It also includes amounts invoiced for other offerings like vehicle rentals, bike/scooter rentals, subscriptions, hardware/software sales, media, sponsorships, partnerships, and licensing/data access agreements.

Therefore, while ""revenue margin"" isn't explicitly defined in these documents, Lyft uses ""Adjusted EBITDA margin (calculated as a percentage of Gross Bookings)"" as a key metric, where Gross Bookings represents the total transaction value on their platform. Uber uses ""Revenue Margin"" in the context of their delivery services.",Revenue Margin is defined as revenue as a percentage of Gross Bookings.,0.19302184819585433,0.7442813499243764,0.99999999995,0.0,1.0

(the ""Company"" or ""Lyft"") started a movement to revolutionize transportation. In 2012, we launched our peer-to-peer marketplace for on- demand ridesharing and have continued to pioneer innovations. Today, Lyft is one of the largest multimodal transportation networks in the United States and Canada. We have an important purpose, which is to get riders out into the world so they can live their lives together, and to provide drivers a way to work that gives them control over their time and money. Our ridesharing marketplace connects drivers with riders via the Lyft mobile application (the ""Lyft App"") in cities across the United States and in select cities in Canada. We have established a scaled network of users brought together by our robust technology platform (the ""Lyft Platform"") that powers rides and connections every day. We leverage our technology platform, the scale and density of our user network and insights from a significant number of rides to improve our ridesharing marketplace efficiency and develop new offerings. We\'ve also taken steps to ensure our network is well positioned to benefit from technological innovation in mobility. Our offerings on the Lyft App include an expanded set of transportation modes in select cities, such as access to a network of shared bikes and scooters (""Light Vehicles"") for shorter rides and first-mile and last-mile legs of multimodal trips. Substantially all of our revenue is generated from our ridesharing marketplace that connects drivers and riders. We collect service fees and commissions from drivers for their use of our ridesharing marketplace. As drivers accept more rider leads, Gross Bookings¹ and Rides¹ increase, driving more revenue. We also generate revenue from riders renting Light Vehicles, drivers renting vehicles through Express Drive and by making our ridesharing marketplace available to organizations through our Lyft Business offerings, such as our Concierge and Lyft Pass programs. In 2021, we began generating revenues from licensing and data access agreements. In 2022, we began generating revenues from the sale of bikes and bike station software and hardware sales substantially through our acquisition of PBSC Urban Solutions Inc (""PBSC""). Riders and drivers want and value choice, and we believe there remains an opportunity for growth in our marketplace. In September 2023, we launched Women+ Connect, a new feature that offers women and nonbinary drivers the option to turn on a preference within the Lyft App to prioritize matches with nearby women and nonbinary riders. We are focused on delivering a great rideshare experience and will continue to innovate for drivers and riders, creating an increasingly differentiated service over time. We are committed to building a durable, healthy and profitable business for riders, drivers and shareholders.', ""# PART I\n\n## Delivery\n\nOur Delivery offering allows consumers to search for and discover the best of local commerce-from restaurants to grocery, alcohol, convenience and other retailers-order a meal or other items, and either pick-up at the restaurant or have it delivered. We refer to the grocery, alcohol, convenience, and retail categories collectively as Grocery & Retail. After launching our Delivery app, Uber Eats, over eight years ago, we believe our Delivery offering increases consumer engagement with the Uber platform overall, which in turn results in broader reach for our Merchants who can attract Uber Eats consumers from Uber without increasing their own costs. For Drivers, we believe the Delivery offering leverages, and has expanded, our earner base by increasing utilization and earnings across the network. We also believe it also attracts new Drivers to the platform who do not have access to Mobility-qualified vehicles. Over the last several years, our Delivery business has expanded to include Uber Direct, our white-label Delivery-as-a-Service offering to retailers and restaurants around the world, as well as advertising opportunities.\n\n## Freight\n\nWe believe that Freight is revolutionizing the logistics industry. Freight powers a managed transportation and logistics network and connects Shippers and Carriers in a digital marketplace to move shipments while leveraging our proprietary technology, brand awareness, and experience revolutionizing industries. Freight provides an on-demand platform to automate and accelerate logistics transactions end-to-end while providing visibility and control of logistics networks. Freight connects Carriers with Shippers' shipments available on our platform, and gives Carriers upfront, transparent pricing and the ability to book a shipment with the touch of a button. Freight serves Shippers ranging from small- and medium-sized businesses to global enterprises. By leveraging logistics solutions expertise and value-add solutions, Freight enables Shippers to create and tender shipments, secure capacity on demand with real-time pricing, and track those shipments from pickup to delivery. Freight operations are principally based in North America and Europe. We believe that all of these factors represent significant efficiency improvements over traditional transportation management and freight brokerage providers.\n\n## Platform Synergies""]","Based on the provided 10K report for Lyft, here's a breakdown of the key benefits for drivers and riders, and how Lyft leverages technology and data:

It is possible that we will not generate taxable income in time to use NOLs before their expiration. Under Section 382 of the 48 Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended, if a corporation undergoes an ""ownership change,"" the corporation\'s ability to use its pre-change NOLs to offset its post-change income may be limited. In general, an ""ownership change"" will occur if there is a cumulative change in our ownership by ""5- percent shareholders"" that exceeds 50 percentage points over a rolling three-year period.

As a result of this error, management concluded that their disclosure controls and procedures were *not* effective as of December 31, 2023, at a reasonable assurance level. The document does not specify the exact actions taken by February 14, 2024, to address the error, but it acknowledges the ineffectiveness of the disclosure controls.

*   **Uber's Certification (Uber):** Uber's 10K, signed on February 15, 2024, includes a certification by the Principal Financial Officer regarding disclosure controls and procedures and internal control over financial reporting. The certification states that the officers are responsible for establishing and maintaining these controls. It also mentions that they have evaluated the effectiveness of these controls and presented their conclusions in the report as of the end of the covered period.

It's important to note that the Lyft document directly links the February 13, 2024, error to a conclusion of ineffective disclosure controls as of December 31, 2023. The Uber document, while signed shortly after the Lyft incident, does not mention any similar errors or conclusions regarding the effectiveness of their disclosure controls.","The clerical error in Uber's financial results press release was promptly corrected on the earnings call and in an updated press release and supplemental slides on February 13, 2024, and in an amendment to the Form 8-K filed with the SEC on February 14, 2024. As of December 31, 2023, Uber's management, with the participation of the principal executive officer and principal financial officer, evaluated the effectiveness of disclosure controls and procedures. Based on this evaluation, they concluded that, due to the deficiency related to the review of forward-looking, non-GAAP directional commentary for fiscal year 2024 that resulted in the clerical error, the disclosure controls and procedures were not effective at a reasonable assurance level.",0.3842237104242415,0.7379764728128885,0.9999999999,0.6666666666666666,0.5833333333333334
